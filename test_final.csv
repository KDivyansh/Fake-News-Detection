PCI Launches Payment Card Cybersecurity Effort in the Middle East,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa. The payment card industry pushes for more security in financial transactions to help combat increasing fraud in the region. April 26, 2024 The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council plans to extend its role to the Middle East, as the volume of card-based payments continues to climb in the region and, along with it, payment-card fraud. In April, the PCI SSC assigned a regional director to the Middle East to work with regulators, banking and financial institutions, and service providers on initiatives to improve the security of card transactions. The move comes as the volume of global card fraud is expected to hit $36 billion in 2024, up from $28 billion in 2020, although the share of fraud compared to transaction volume will shrink slightly, to 6.5 cents per $100, according to the annual ""Nilson Report"" released in December. The PCI SSC plans to work closely with any organization that handles payments within the Middle East payment ecosystem, with a focus on security, says Nitin Bhatnagar, PCI Security Standards Council regional director for India and South Asia, who will now also oversee efforts in the Middle East. ""Cyberattacks and data breaches on payment infrastructure are a global problem,"" he says. ""Threats such as malware, ransomware, and phishing attempts continue to increase the risk of security breaches. Overall, there is a need for a mindset change."" The push comes as the payment industry itself faces significant changes, with alternatives to traditional payment cards taking off, and as financial fraud has grown in the Middle East. Through 2027, the payments industry will likely grow at an annual rate of 6.2% — a healthy pace, albeit lower than the 8.3% growth rate of the past five years, according to a September 2023 report published by the Boston Consulting Group. While card-based financial transactions continue to dominate, accounting for more than $30 trillion in point-of-sale and e-commerce transactions in 2023, alternate payment methods are taking off, totaling more than $11 trillion in 2023 and growing at twice the rate of card-based payments, according to BCG's Global Payments Model. Currently, there are more than 5,000 fintechs globally that account for $100 billion in revenue, a number set to grow to $520 billion by 2030, according to BCG. The Middle East is one region where the changes are most pronounced. Middle East consumers prefer digital wallets to cards, 60% to 27%, as their most preferred method of payment, while consumers in the Asia-Pacific region slightly prefer cards, 43% to 38%, according to an August 2021 report by consultancy McKinsey & Company. Cybercriminals follow these shifts as well, and that worries businesses in the region. Seven out of every 10 businesses executives in the United Arab Emirates, for example, believe financial crimes risks will worsen in the next 12 months, essentially the same as US executives, according to the ""2023 Fraud and Financial Crime Report"" published by consultancy Kroll. The PCI Security Standards Council plans to adapt to the digital landscape, and in November 2022 introduced a mobile payments standard, PCI Mobile Payments on COTS (MPoC), which provides a standard for development of mobile-app-based payments. ""Emerging technologies and innovation are reshaping our industry, along with the rise in popularity of mobile payments and contactless transactions,"" Bhatnagar says. ""Organizations need to become aware of security risks and take them seriously, because the criminals take it seriously — their sole objective is to break into an organization and steal data and monetize it."" Preventing payments fraud has become a priority in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, as efforts to improve financial inclusion have led to more mobile payment and digital bank accounts. The open source Tazama Project, for example, is building an antifraud platform for banks and governments to allow them to use data on account holders and transactions to detect likely fraud. Meanwhile, Network International, a digital commerce platform in the Middle East and Africa, adopted Mastercard's AI-powered fraud-prevention solution to reduce fraud in digital transactions. ""Organizations should start prioritizing data security as an important element in their day-to-day business activities,"" Bhatnagar says. ""Investing in cybersecurity is equally important. Getting employees trained and improving on cyber hygiene will help organizations take steps in the right direction."" Technologies like generative AI could both help and hurt payment security. While cybercriminals are increasingly using the technology to part consumers from their cash, businesses are...",10 hours ago,1

Thoma Bravo To Acquire Security AI Pioneer Darktrace For $5.3B,"The AI-focused cybersecurity vendor is slated to join a private equity portfolio that includes numerous security industry companies. Darktrace CEO Poppy Gustafsson says the deal will enable ‘the next stage in our growth journey.’








Thoma Bravo has reached an agreement to acquire AI-powered security trailblazer Darktrace for $5.32 billion, as the private equity firm looks to add another major cybersecurity vendor to its portfolio.
In a comment included as part of a regulatory filing, Darktrace CEO Poppy Gustafsson said the proposed acquisition—which would constitute taking the company private—will provide support for “the next stage in our growth journey.”
[Related: The 20 Hottest AI Cybersecurity Companies: The 2024 CRN AI 100]
Darktrace noted in the filing that its board believes that the company’s “operating and financial achievements have not been reflected commensurately in its valuation with shares trading at a significant discount to its global peer group.”
Founded in 2013, Darktrace was early to the idea that AI/ML could be used for improving detection of cyberattacks. The Cambridge, U.K.-based company went public on the London Stock Exchange in 2021, but by the following year was in talks with Thoma Bravo over an acquisition deal. The negotiations reportedly fell apart over price disagreements.
The deal that has now been reached offers Darktrace shareholders a 20 percent premium over the closing price Thursday for shares in the vendor. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders.
Thoma Bravo has been a prolific acquirer of cybersecurity vendors in recent years, with a portfolio that currently includes Proofpoint, Sophos and SailPoint, along with significant stakes in a number of other security vendors.
The private equity firm also owns Ping Identity, which the firm combined with another identity security vendor, ForgeRock, in August.
In a statement included in the regulatory filing, Thoma Bravo Partner Andrew Almeida said that Darktrace is “at the very cutting edge of cybersecurity technology.”
“We have long been admirers of its platform and capability in artificial intelligence,” Almeida said in the comment, adding that “we will bring to bear the full range of our platform, operational expertise and deep experience of cybersecurity in supporting Darktrace’s growth.""
Along with detection, Darktrace has expanded its self-learning AI technology to include attack prevention, response and remediation—spanning cloud, applications, email, endpoint and network environments. Last summer, the company unveiled a new product, Heal, that leverages AI to assist with cyber incident response.",48 minutes ago,1

 The Russian independent news website Meduza is facing repeated attempts to disrupt its digital infrastructure, researchers have found. 
 In March, Meduza said that it became the target of ""the most intense cyber campaign"" in its history, preceding the presidential election in Russia during the same month. The organization attributed the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incident to the Russian authorities. 
 Even after the election in March, which granted the country's authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin another six-year term, the onslaughts against Meduza’s website have continued, increasing in intensity and variety, according to a report released this week by the Sweden-based digital forensics organization Qurium. DDoS attacks flood a website with traffic, with the intention of disrupting it or bringing it down. 
 Meduza markets itself as one of the few Russian independent media outlets whose coverage remains free from control or censorship by the Kremlin. Meduza relocated its office to Latvia back in 2014, and people living in Russia today can only access its website through a VPN. 
 In 2023, the Russian government designated Meduza as an “undesirable organization” in Russia, subjecting it to heavy fines and potential prison sentences for employees. The organization said in the past that the Russian authorities are trying to “completely destroy” it. 
 In April, Meduza faced two large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, prompting it to reach out to Qurium to investigate their origin and composition, the researchers said. 
 The first attack started on April 15 and lasted about 48 hours. Over those two days, Meduza's website was targeted by 2 billion fake user requests, researchers said. According to Meduza, this is several hundred times more than the typical number of requests generated by its audience. 
 Qurium detected nearly 6,300 IP addresses that generated these requests with varying intensity — from several million requests per hour to several thousand. Meduza said that this attack was the largest in its history. 
 The second DDoS attack, which started on April 18, appeared “completely different” both in terms of the technologies used by hackers and their tactics, according to Meduza. This attack lasted just one hour but used 10 times more IP addresses than the previous one. 
 The botnet behind the recent attacks on Meduza likely operated from compromised routers or malware in desktop computers located outside of Europe, according to Qurium. 
 During the analysis, researchers identified three proxy providers behind these attacks: Plain Proxies, Min Proxy, and RapidSeedBox. Proxy providers help hackers — knowingly or unknowingly — in masking the origin of the cyberattack, making it difficult for the target to defend against or mitigate it. 
 According to Qurium, two of the identified proxy providers, Plain Proxies and Min Proxy, were also linked to last year's attacks against Hungarian media critical of the current political regime. 
 Responding to Qurium's analysis of the recent attacks, Meduza said they don't know for sure who could be behind them but points to the Kremlin. 
 ""We know that this is a very expensive attack, and its purpose is not just to disrupt the operation of our website and mobile application, but to make our resources stop working. Only Russian authorities can have such a goal. And they will continue trying to achieve it.""

Individuals receiving healthcare across Los Angeles had their personal and health data compromised following a successful phishing attack against Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, which is the second largest U.S. public healthcare system, in February, according to BleepingComputer.
Malicious phishing emails delivered between Feb. 19 and 20 have enabled attackers to infiltrate the email accounts of 23 employees, which contained patients' names, birthdates, home and email addresses phone numbers, medical record numbers, client identification number, medical details, and/or health plan information, said LA County Health Services. However, no Social Security numbers and financial data have been compromised as a result of the incident, which has already been remediated through a reset of all impacted employee email accounts and more extensive screening of suspicious emails.
There has been no indication of any misuse of the exposed data so far but impacted individuals have been urged to promptly verify their medical records with their health providers.

China-linked PlugX malware infections found in more than 170 countries,"Leadership Cybercrime Nation-state Elections Technology Cyber Daily® Click Here Podcast ✉️ Free Newsletter A strain of malware connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security has been found in more than 170 countries, according to cybersecurity researchers who took control of a command and control server linked to it. Experts at cybersecurity firm Sekoia said they successfully took over the server in September 2023, giving them access to a trove of information about how far the PlugX malware has spread. The malware was initially developed by front companies linked to the Chinese agency in 2008 and has been used widely among the country’s espionage groups. In 2020, hackers within a group labeled Mustang Panda added a capability to the malware that allowed it to spread to connected USB flash drives — with the goal of gaining access to non-connected networks. Cybersecurity researchers at Sophos said last year that they saw “localized outbreaks” of a new variant of PlugX being spread through the USB drives in Mongolia, Zimbabwe and Nigeria after initial campaigns in Papua New Guinea and Ghana in January 2023. Sekoia’s team purchased the unique IP address tied to the variant identified by Sophos for $7 and found “between 90 to 100k unique IP addresses are sending PlugX distinctive requests every day.” “We initially thought that we will have a few thousand victims connected to it, as what we can have on our regular sinkholes. However, by setting up a simple web server we saw a continuous flow of HTTP requests varying through the time of the day,” Sekoia said. “We observed in 6 months of sinkholing more than 2.5 million unique IPs connecting to it.” Palo Alto Networks released a lengthy report on PlugX in 2021 and several companies have found it used in attacks on governments and companies around the world. In a one-day snapshot of PlugX activity, Sekoia found that around 15 countries account for over 80% of the total infections — led by Nigeria, India, Iran, Indonesia, the United States and more: Sekoia noted that the leading infected countries don’t share many similarities — suggesting the possibility that the malware “might have originated from multiple patient zeros in different countries.” “The geographical distribution of the most infected countries, as presented on the previous map, may indicate a possible motivation behind this worm. However, this must be taken with a grain of salt, because after four years of activities, it had time to spread everywhere,” they said. “Many nations, excluding India, are participants in China’s Belt and Road Initiative and have, for most of them, coastlines where Chinese infrastructure investments are significant. Analyzing the geographical distribution of the infections from a security perspective reveals that numerous affected countries are located in regions of strategic importance for the security of the Belt and Road Initiative – like the straits of Malacca, Hormuz, Beb-el-Mandeb or Plak.” The researchers said that while China invests everywhere, it is plausible that the malware was “developed to collect intelligence in various countries about the strategic and security concerns associated with the Belt and Road Initiative, mostly on its maritime and economic aspects.” Mustang Panda is also well-known for targeting the governments of countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. Sekoia eventually discovered that it was possible to send commands that would force the malware to destroy itself, disinfecting a system. But the researchers worried about the potential legal challenges that could arise from the kind of widespread disinfection campaign only law enforcement agencies like the FBI have embarked on. In the end, they decided to “defer the decision on whether to disinfect workstations in their respective countries to the discretion of national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), and cybersecurity authorities.” Those agencies can decide to remove the implant from the infected host, remotely if they so choose, Sekoia said. “Since some workstations located in one country can connect to the internet through another country (such as via VPNs or satellite internet providers), these authorities provide in return a list of autonomous systems that are OK to be disinfected,” they said. “Once in possession of the disinfection list, we can provide them an access to start the disinfection for a period of three months. During this time, any PlugX request from an Autonomous System marked for disinfection will be responded to with a removal command or a removal payload.” But the researchers noted that the malware can still exist on networks that are not connected to the internet...",3 hours ago,1
Five Essential Steps To Land Your First Cyber Security Job,"CEO and cofounder of Cyber Leadership Institute, a fast-growing community of cyberleaders from more than 50 countries. As cyberattacks intensify, so does the demand for cybersecurity professionals. According to the 2023 Cyber Security Workforce Study by ISC2, one of the largest cyber security associations, roughly 4 million cybersecurity experts are needed worldwide. Predictably, an increasing number of recent graduates and midlife career changers are seeking to break into this booming sector, lured by promises of six-figure salaries and flexible work arrangements. But landing a cyber security job feels like a distant dream for most hopefuls. Here are five tips to improve your chances of landing a cybersecurity job. Participating in capture-the-flag (CTF) cyber security contests is a fantastic way to show initiative and sharpen your analytical skills. These online competitions provide safe spaces for cyber enthusiasts to outthink and outwit their peers by probing systems for weaknesses and fending off adversarial attacks. One of the most popular hacking competitions happens at DEFCON, a technology summit where more than 6,000 hackers and security professionals gather annually in Las Vegas. CTF contests can sharpen your analytical, cyber defense and problem-solving skills, further isolating you from the competition. Immersing yourself in a group of like-minded peers will reinvigorate your passion and broaden your network. I believe it is becoming increasingly important that your resume shows capture-the-flag achievements to demonstrate your practical understanding of cyber defense tactics. You should find a hacking contest commensurate with your technical knowledge and work up as your confidence and skills improve. Google, for example, offers a range of high-quality hacking challenges for beginners and seasoned professionals. Have you ever wondered why most cybersecurity professionals hail from networking, systems administration or coding backgrounds? Because cyber security is all about protecting systems. The deeper your IT knowledge, the higher your chances of excelling in cyber security in the same way a doctor who deeply understands human anatomy is more likely to give a better prognosis. Reference YouTube videos to set up a simple home network. Once you have verified connectivity between your servers and client machines, intentionally install vulnerable applications and practice ethical hacking techniques. Tinkering with tech improves your IT, vulnerability discovery and cyber defense skills, differentiating yourself from your academic counterparts. Cybersecurity certifications equip you with cyber risk management fundamentals and demonstrate a commitment to learn and keep up to date with the rapidly evolving cybersecurity industry. According to ISC2, 70% of U.S.-based cybersecurity professionals are required to have a certification by their employers. Choosing which certificate to pursue can be tricky, though, given the number of them. Your aspirations and professional background must inform the path you take. If you aspire to become a penetration tester, for example, a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN) may be most relevant. However, a Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) may be most suitable if you want to pursue a career in cyber security governance. Consider alternative paths if you have been applying for cyber roles without luck. Apply for a systems administrator, IT audit, technology risk or any other role whose skills are transferable to cyber security. After a couple of years, I've seen how switching over to cyber security becomes much easier. Once you step into that intermediate role, show up with heart and establish yourself as the go-to person in that department. Organize coffee catchups with your cyber security colleagues and connect with them personally. Learn about their roles, key challenges and the best parts of their jobs. This will help you identify a niche aligned with your passion. When a new cyber role opens, they will likely think of you first. People generally prefer to hire those they know, like and trust. Your networks will ultimately prove more valuable than any degrees or professional certs you might hold. Most cyber security professional associations like ISC2 and ISACA have vibrant grassroots chapters. RI recommends that you regularly attend local cyber security meetups and develop professional relationships that could lead to your first cyber security breakthrough. Raise your visibility by volunteering to organize events or pick up other administrative functions. According to a study, volunteers have a 27% better chance of finding a job than those who don’t. Once you have cemented professional bonds, politely ask some contacts to pass your resume to their human resources. Internal recommendations carry enormous weight. Cybersecurity has evolved greatly over the last decade. It's no longer a secluded space for geeks in hoodies toiling from their basements. It’s now a...",4 days ago,1

California high school student Jordan Brace and PragerU Kids outreach director Jill Simonian discuss the decline in the California education system as leaders prioritize 'woke' initiatives. Fox News' Ashley Strohmier reports.
California high school student Jordan Brace took a hard stance against the progressive state’s approach to education, which she branded a ""failure.""
Brace explained on ""Fox News @ Night"" Wednesday that her state ranks 33rd nationally in math and 38th in reading, placements that she believes are too low. 
California was ranked 38th overall for Pre-K through 12th grade education, according to U.S. News and World Report. 
In her op-ed, Brace wrote: ""It seems like the entire California Department of Education is more focused on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and their woke ideologies than giving students a proper education.""
California Department of Education statistics show less than half of students performed at their grade level in English, math and science in the 2022-2023 school year. 
NEW CALIFORNIA LAW GIVES THE STATE MORE POWER OVER LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS
""I feel that kids my age and just all throughout our country are now being exposed to diversity, equity and inclusion rather than conservative values and things that they should be learning about,"" she explained to host Trace Gallagher. ""Instead of focusing on DEI and things that are being used to divide us, we should be focusing more on students’ education and making sure that they have the skills and tools that they need to have a successful future.""
Jill Simonian, outreach director for PragerU Kids, said the statistics coming out of California’s education system are ""terrifying"" and warned students are not being taught the fundamentals of becoming an informed adult. 
But Brace’s op-ed provided hope. 
""It really proves that young people are intelligent, and they are catching on to this, and they're not going to have it anymore,"" Simonian said. 
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FORCED TO SPEND $2 BILLION OF COVID-RELIEF FUNDS TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS AFTER LAWSUIT
Brace then expanded her argument to include the Department of Education as a whole, saying it’s ""very important"" for young people to look to their parents as role models and for direction.
""I honestly think that this school system is not only failing students, but parents too. They're taking away not only their rights to their children's education, but their rights to their lives at home. I mean, parents who aren't allowing their children to go ahead and transition their genders and stuff are being called domestic terrorists, and I think that's absolutely ridiculous,"" she explained.
Simonian agreed, emphasizing the importance of instilling values at home so that children are well-equipped to enter the world as adults.
""It's our job to become educated and informed citizens of this country,"" Simonian said. ""And our school system, not only in California but nationwide, we are the only school system that is actively teaching our children to hate this country and to divide each other by differences. It’s shameful.""

"Md. Board of Education picks Carey Wright as permanent public schools 
superintendent","Maryland Matters April 24, 2024, 9:09 PM This article was republished with permission from WTOP’s news partners at Maryland Matters. Sign up for Maryland Matters’ free email subscription today. She’s staying put. The interim title will be removed from Carey Wright’s name after the Maryland Board of Education’s unanimous vote Wednesday to make her the permanent state superintendent of public schools. Wright began as interim superintendent Oct. 23, replacing Mohammed Choudhury, who resigned days prior to become senior adviser for the state school board with a base salary of $310,000 until his contract expires June 30. Wright, a Maryland native who received a $350,000 salary that was prorated for the remainder of her term until June 30, led several initiatives during her half-year leading the state school system of nearly 890,000 students. She will begin her term as the state’s permanent leader July 1 until June 30, 2028, at an annual salary of $360,500. Wright, who began in the education profession as a teacher in the Prince George’s County public schools in September 1972, thanked the board and said one of her goals is to listen to all stakeholders to improve public education. “We want all of our children to be as successful as they can possibly be and it’s our job to support them to get there,” she said. “I am committed and determined to make Maryland the education destination.” In December, the state school board retained Hazard, Young, Attea & Associates (HYA) of Illinois to help conduct a nationwide search. The firm that has conducted searches for various school systems in Maryland worked alongside the school board’s search committee to help recruit and vet qualified candidates. At the end of the application deadline on March 1, nearly 40 people expressed interest with 26 “fully completing” applications. The board announced a special meeting April 13, but went into an executive session. On that day, the board interviewed semi-finalists and narrowed it down to the final candidates. On Wednesday, the board voted to retain Wright. “We looked all across the country and you came to us as one of the top national leaders and our are thorough search found that,” said board Vice President Joshua Michael, who chaired the board’s search committee. “You have both the experience and knowledge of being a Marylander and of Maryland schools and the disposition, experience and skill set to lead the reform and the improvement in public schools.” Wright began working on statewide priorities such as incorporating the science of reading in all 24 school systems starting in the 2024-25 school year. The program, which Wright led during her tenure as state schools chief in Mississippi, focuses on teaching students based on phonics instructions sound, comprehension and vocabulary. Wright testified this year in Annapolis, urging lawmakers to fully fund public education and to continue to support the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform. The 10-year, multi-billion-dollar Blueprint plan is overseen by the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB), which Wright supports. However, the Blueprint mandates continue to vex local school officials, who have outlined in Blueprint documents their challenges in hiring new teachers amid a shortage in the profession, expanding prekindergarten to include 3- and 4-year-old children and incorporating college and career readiness programs into the curriculum. Wright is leading other education initiatives such as sending literacy expert teams to visit schools and the release of a statewide literacy plan later this year. In addition, she is creating strategies to boost math test scores and has established a joint committee with representatives from the state Higher Education Commission and University System of Maryland to assess educator programs. The state Department of Education released a leadership profile report in January to highlight agency strengths and challenges, which was based on 564 interviews and surveys with various state, regional and local agencies and organizations, parents and students. Some of the strengths, according to the report, include the push for education reform, continued support of the Blueprint and collaboration between the state board, department officials and staff and other stakeholders. The challenges include ensuring equitable experiences for all students, the challenges of the state superintendent working in collaboration with both the state board and the AIB, and state officials trying to encourage Blueprint “buy in” with some local school officials. One challenge mentioned several times is how to improve relationships between the department, local school systems and the community. “Transparency between the State Superintendent and all stakeholder groups was mentioned in interviews and focus groups as a significant...",1 day ago,1

Fincher said there’s been high interest in applying for the upcoming student lottery for spots, and the directors of the lab school have spoken to high school students throughout the school’s partnership region. Roanoke College’s Explore@RC plans to work with Salem City Schools to offer tracks for education/global studies, STEM/health care and communications/civic engagement. Participating Salem High School students will be dual enrolled in college-level courses on Roanoke College’s campus. “Our team is so excited to launch Explore@RC,” Lisa Stoneman, chair of Roanoke’s Education Department, said in a statement Thursday. “These initial dual-enrollment courses are just the beginning of our community outreach vision. Growing into our 150-student capacity and extending on-campus learning opportunities to middle and elementary students is part of our dream for a lab school that will positively impact the region as well as the students and faculty at Roanoke.” Explore@RC will accept up to 40 students for its first year, with classes beginning in August. Enrollment is open now, and a lottery system will be used if the number of applications exceeds capacity, according to Stoneman and Natasha Watts, executive director of Explore@RC. Four other lab schools also were approved Thursday: George Mason University’s Accelerated College and Employability Skills Academy Lab School will work with Northern Virginia Community College and Fairfax County Public Schools to serve at-risk youth working primarily toward careers in information technology. Old Dominion University will host two lab schools. In Newport News, it will operate the Maritime Engineering and Environmental Studies Academy, partnering with Newport News Public Schools. In Chesapeake, ODU will launch the Computer Science Lab School, which will work with students from Chesapeake Public Schools’ Oscar Smith Middle School. Paul D. Camp Community College will launch the Isle of Maritime Trades Academy and plans to work with Isle of Wight County Public Schools and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding to train students in maritime trades. Emory & Henry and Roanoke College are the only private schools to receive full approval out of the 12 proposals the Board of Education has signed off on to date. Higher education institutions that wanted to host a lab school first applied for an introductory grant of up to $200,000 to allow for planning...",7 hours ago,1
"Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont pushes for more financial literacy education in 
schools","""Today we want people to have the basic skills they need to live.""
Half of the country now has state laws that require financial literacy for high schoolers, teaching them the ins and outs of balancing a checkbook, opening a bank account and more.
Some educators and elected officials, like Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, are calling for such programs to be taught nationwide.
Lamont, who pushed for the program in his state last year, spoke with ABC News Live's Linsey Davis Tuesday about the issue.
ABC NEWS LIVE: So give us a sense, one year later: Has the requirement made a big difference?
GOV. NED LAMONT: We're just getting started, but it's going to be a requirement in all of our high schools to have the credit. You and I took economics maybe some years ago. Me, back in the Ming Dynasty, was microeconomics. [It was] not very relevant. Today we want people to have the basic skills they need to live, be it take out a bank loan or a mortgage, balancing the checkbook, credit card overpayment, draft fees, [and] basics of life.

ABC NEWS LIVE: So our government could probably benefit from this. Balancing the checkbook, not over-drafting. All of that. What do you say to those who argue that this is important but shouldn't be a requirement?
LAMONT: I think what is necessary to live in the 21st century should be a requirement. And we've been teaching economics, as I joked, [in] a variety of different ways over the last 100 years. But making it relevant to people's lives makes education come to life, and that's what we're trying to do.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Congress just hosted its annual bipartisan financial literacy fair on Capitol Hill. So there's an obvious eagerness for this in Washington. Is there a push for a national adoption of this as a requirement for high schoolers, and do you think there should be?
LAMONT: I think it makes pretty good sense. If you want to give us another year to see how it works out and how we're really making things happen, then come to Connecticut. We'll tell you what we got right and what we got to work on.
ABC NEWS LIVE: As governor of a state, you've pushed for regulation of social media in our classrooms, talking about the distraction it poses to children. You brought up TikTok, in particular in your last State of the State address, and the app could very well be banned soon due to legislation on Capitol Hill, as you well know. You've said a national ban would be a ""slippery slope."" How so?
LAMONT: I think when you start telling people what they can watch or what they can't watch, that could be a slippery slope. I would be very careful about that. But Linsey, what we've done in Connecticut, I recommend it to all of our superintendents. Let's get the smartphones out of the schools, or at least out of the classrooms. And we're coming up with a policy there that superintendents can act on, where you maybe drop your iPhone into a Yondr pouch on your way into the school, and you pick it up at the end of the day. In the meantime, you listen and actually interact with your fellow students.

ABC NEWS LIVE: Interaction with fellow students. What a novel idea there. But I am curious, do you think that TikTok poses a security threat?
LAMONT: I think potentially it does. And it's not necessarily by a foreign government, but ByteDance, which has major American investors in it, as you probably know. You know, there is a risk there. I rely upon the intelligence community. I just say I want to be very careful before you abridge people's First Amendment rights, [and] what they can say and what they can do. We do that carefully.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Understood. I am curious, would you disagree with the president if he were to sign legislation banning it?
LAMONT: No, I think I'd follow his lead on that. He has more of the intelligence briefings than I do. I would just say be careful. Our freedoms are often abridged in the name of national security. Be careful.

Professor Nonie Lesaux will become interim dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), acting Harvard President Alan Garber announced today. Lesaux, the Roy Edward Larsen Professor of Education and Human Development, will assume the role at the conclusion of Dean Bridget Terry Long’s tenure at the end of the 2023–24 academic year. Long announced her pending departure as dean in January 2024. In a statement, Garber announced Lesaux’s appointment and described the search process for a permanent dean. He also praised Lesaux’s commitment to education and to the HGSE community in replacing Long moving forward. “Nonie is a widely respected scholar and educator whose work appears in numerous scholarly publications and has influenced state and national educational policy,” Garber wrote in an email to the Harvard community. “We are grateful to Nonie for her willingness to lead the school in this interim period, and we hope you will join us in congratulating her on this new role.” Lesaux served as academic dean at HGSE from 2017 to 2021, succeeding Long, who held that post for four years. She was previously named the Juliana W. and William Foss Thompson Professor of Education and Society before her appointment to the Larsen chair in 2021. “I am deeply honored to serve in the role of interim dean,” Lesaux said. “I have seen firsthand the positive impact that our exceptional faculty, dedicated staff, and inspiring students and alumni make in the field of education. Their steadfast commitment to our mission — and expanding educational opportunities for learners everywhere — is a source of energy and hope.” A native of Canada, Lesaux earned her doctorate in educational psychology and special education from the University of British Columbia in 2003. Her research focuses on promoting language and literacy skills of children from diverse linguistic, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Working largely through partnerships with school districts, states, and communities, Lesaux has worked to improve literacy rates, including seven years with San Diego Unified and 10 years with the New York City Department of Education. Lesaux serves as co-chair of the Saul Zaentz Early Education Initiative at HGSE, which addresses the global challenge of improving the quality of early education and has informed a new era of science and policymaking in early education, building a network and partnerships representing all 50 U.S. states and 92 countries. A former chair of the Massachusetts Board of Early Education Care, Lesaux has been instrumental in efforts to improve third grade reading outcomes in Massachusetts. Her work authoring a state-level literacy report was the basis for a Third Grade Reading Proficiency bill passed in the state legislature. The bill established an Early Literacy Expert Panel, which Lesaux co-chairs, and is tasked with developing new policies and initiatives to impact early childhood literacy development. The practical applications of her research are featured in several books for school leaders and educators. She is co-editor of the Handbook of Reading Research (2022) and recently published...",24 hours ago,1
Carey Wright will continue to lead Maryland schools as superintendent,"The Maryland State Board of Education on Wednesday appointed Carey Wright, a former Mississippi schools chief who started her career in the D.C. region, to serve as the next state superintendent of schools.
Wright, the current interim state superintendent, will be charged with steering the Department of Education as it implements the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a landmark education law that funnels billions into public schools in hopes of making the state’s education system one of the best in the nation.
“Growing up in Maryland and spending a majority of my career in Maryland, I knew how good our schools were, and I also know how much better we can be,” Wright said after the vote.
Joshua Michael, the board member who chaired the search committee, said that 26 people completed an application for the job, but “the board coalesced strongly” around Wright.
Michael — who is also vice president of the state board — added that Wright had “extensive experience as an education leader, both in Maryland and nationally in public schools” and a “track record of championing reform.”
In Maryland, the State Board of Education hires the superintendent, and the governor appoints members to that board. Gov. Wes Moore (D) has so far appointed six people to the 14-member board. Wright was unanimously approved by the state board members present; one member was absent.
Moore said in a news release that Wright’s career in public education has “uniquely prepared her to meet this moment” as the leader of the state education system.
“She is a champion for students, and I’m confident that she is the leader we need to fulfill the promise of creating a world-class public education system for Maryland,” Moore said.
Wright was named interim state superintendent in October, after former state superintendent of schools Mohammed Choudhury lost support from the board.
An investigation by The Washington Post last year found that several former staffers alleged that Choudhury created a “toxic” work environment that drove out his lieutenants and dozens of veterans in the education agency. Former employees alleged that he had a pattern of micromanagement that held up important work, and several district leaders quietly expressed confusion about the Blueprint and other guidance from the department. Choudhury said the former employees could not embrace change.
Since Choudhury’s departure, Wright has been guiding the state’s Education Department, which oversees 24 school districts with about 890,000 students enrolled. She was tasked by the state board with developing a literacy policy that would incorporate more elements of the “science of reading,” a methodology that places an emphasis on phonics while teaching kids how to read. The board set a goal of getting Maryland to place among the top 10 states in reading on the fourth- and eighth-grade National Assessment for Educational Progress, or NAEP — a standardized test sometimes called “the gold standard” of student assessment — by 2027.
The state ranked 40th in the nation in fourth-grade reading on the most recent NAEP assessment. It ranked 25th for eighth-graders.
Wright has had success boosting performance. She is known in the education world as the Mississippi superintendent who raised student reading and math performance in a state that for decades received low scores on the NAEP.
Wright is a homegrown Maryland educator. She started her career in Prince George’s County Public Schools — the state’s second largest school system. She also served stints within the Howard and Montgomery county school systems, before becoming the chief academic officer and deputy chief for D.C. Public Schools’ Office of Teaching and Learning.
In 2013, she was named Mississippi’s state superintendent of education. She retired from that post in 2022.
After the vote Wednesday, several board members congratulated Wright.
“I think we’re on the right track, and we are so happy to have you,” said Susan Getty, a state board member from Carroll County.
Wright said her goal is to “listen to all voices at all times” and “make Maryland the education destination.” She added that she intends to focus on improving literacy at all grade levels.
“I’m energized by this work. This is work I love,” Wright said. “I am committed to doing everything that I can possibly do to improve outcomes for our children.”
She will start her four-year term in Maryland on July 1 at a salary of $360,500.",1 day ago,1

Windham parents claim a legal victory in suit over education,"Abundant sunshine. High 62F. Winds light and variable.. A clear sky. Low near 30F. Winds light and variable. Updated: April 26, 2024 @ 10:41 am General Assignment Reporter Windham Elementary School NEWFANE — Parents of Windham Elementary students involved in a lawsuit alleging the lack of an equitable educational opportunity are celebrating a legal victory. In a decision signed Wednesday, Judge David Barra ruled the parents have made a valid claim against the state of Vermont in their case claiming the Windham School District had failed to provide a basic education for students as required by the Vermont Constitution. The claim alleges ""deprivation of the constitutional right to an education"" under the Education Clause of the Vermont Constitution to provide ""quality basic education"" as defined by state standards. “While Judge Barra’s ruling dismissed our parents’ other claims in this case, with which we respectfully disagree, the ruling on the issue of the right to a basic education is a major win for Windham parents, as well as for other parents across the state,"" Deborah Bucknam, attorney for the plaintiffs, said in an announcement Thursday. ""A claim of educational malpractice is rarely, if ever, allowed to go forward in any court in the United States. It speaks to the terrible conditions at the Windham Elementary School."" Plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in Windham Superior Court, Civil Division in August 2023. The defendants — the state, town, Windham Central Supervisory Union and Windham School District — filed motions to dismiss the suit. ""[B]ased on the barrage of allegations that Plaintiffs propound, tending to show that the Windham Elementary School failed to provide 'quality basic education' ... Plaintiffs have alleged enough to state a claim for a declaration to that effect against the State of Vermont — the entity with the 'fundamental obligation' to provide the 'fundamental right' to education in Vermont,"" the decision states. ""The same, however, cannot be said as against the remaining Defendants, who do not have that 'fundamental obligation' to discharge."" Another count in the complaint alleged violation of the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution. The complaint also requested the court declare the defendants are violating their children's rights under the Vermont Constitution, issue an injunction ordering the defendants to provide town tuitioning to the children, and award damages to the plaintiffs who have been forced to pay tuition or who have remained at Windham Elementary. Since the lawsuit was filed, the School Board voted 2-1 to temporarily close the school building and provide tuition for students to attend Townshend Elementary School due to staffing issues. At annual Town Meeting in March, the community voted to provide school choice for elementary education and rejected an operating budget for Windham Elementary. ""Windham families spoke up forcefully at the town meeting, giving several reasons for their fear and dislike of the Windham Elementary School, which is currently closed. They particularly cited the school board’s inability to affirm that the school would be improved in the immediate future, given lack of staff and serious deficiencies in the school plant,"" the Windham Committee for School Choice said in an statement at the time. ""The resounding victory for the solid majority of parents who wanted school choice was unexpected, and suggested that some pro-school voters at town meeting changed their minds on the basis of what they learned from the unhappy parents."" Last week, the board decided to warn a vote to ask the community if the school building should be closed. Voters also will consider allowing the board to spend $557,344 for tuition and other costs, and to pay tuition for state-approved elementary schools in an amount not to exceed the statewide elementary school tuition. Bucknam said she's heard from parents all over Vermont, sharing similar stories. ""Many Vermont kids are not receiving the basic education the Vermont Supreme Court has held is every Vermont schoolchild’s fundamental constitutional right,"" she said in the announcement. “The educational establishment in Vermont has too often failed our children. A powerful way to fix the problem would be to allow parents to choose what school their kids will attend, which will steer tax dollars to schools that work and force educators all across the state to improve the quality of education. With such financial power in the hands of parents, they will be able to ensure their children will receive the education they are entitled to under the Vermont Constitution.” Superintendent Bob Thibault declined to comment. A spokesperson from the Vermont Agency of Education could not...",19 hours ago,1
Texas lawmakers establish new school safety policies,"Texas lawmakers have mandated armed guards at every public school, panic buttons in classrooms and more staff training. Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. In response to the deadliest school shooting in Texas, lawmakers have upped legislation concerning gun and school safety. House Bill 3 passed late last year, which created the requirement for an armed security guard to be present on all campuses and also ramped up mental health resources for students. In Texas, the responsibility for establishing the guidelines for public school safety belongs to the Texas Education Agency and Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office along with the TxSSC. These rules have been updated since the 2022 tragedy in Uvalde, but some experts worry that parents and guardians still don’t know the intricacies of school safety policy. Brian Clason, program manager of training and education for the Texas State School Safety Center, says the best thing parents can do to protect their children is to develop relationships with teachers and school faculty to learn more about safety protocols before an emergency occurs. “Your school leaders should know who you are, and you should know who they are,” he said. Here’s a guide for parents and guardians on how to appropriately navigate an emergency whether it’s an active threat such as an armed intruder or bomb, natural disaster or hazmat situation. During a school emergency, emotions can run high. The instinct to contact or go to your child’s school may seem like the right idea. However, in the parental guide for school safety created by the TxSSC, they advise parents to wait for instructions from their child’s school before acting. Traffic from parents or guardians all at once may flood the school’s phone lines. All schools are mandated by the TEA to immediately contact parents or guardians during a threat of violence through text, email or an app. To ensure the process is as accurate and streamlined as possible, parents and guardians are encouraged to keep current contact info with the school to receive notifications and updates when necessary. In the event of an active shooter, the TxSSC advises to refrain from calling or texting your child — as it may put themselves and others in danger if they are hiding and have not silenced their phone. New legislation that was recently passed added five requirements for school districts to enact in addition to the existing policies. School districts must: Drills All Texas school districts and open-enrollment charter schools are required to conduct a set amount of drills during the school year. These drills are designed to prepare students, faculty and staff for how to react in the event of a potential safety hazard. They include: Each drill ranges in protocol depending on the severity of a situation. Secure drills, which may be employed if there is criminal activity near campus, allow school activities to carry on as usual, however, no one is able to leave or enter the school. Lockdown and shelter-in-place drills both interrupt classroom activity. Lockdown drills prepare students for danger within the school, such as an active shooter, and the latter for weather emergencies. The number of fire drills are determined through consultation with a fire marshall. Because districts may vary in the amount of drills held, parents and guardians are encouraged to reach out to their child’s school security with questions. Arms on campus It is now required that all schools must have an armed security officer on the premises, but it is up to the school district to determine how many officers are present at each school. These officers may be hired from a security company, local law enforcement or may be commissioned peace officers. School employees may also be armed if they complete either the school marshal program or the “guardian plan.” Each route differs in methodology — with the school marshal plan requiring the completion of an 80-hour course, and costs upwards of $30,000, while the “Guardian Plan” requires a minimum of 16 hours and costs approximately $1,900. Completion of either route would allow school employees to be permitted to carry and possess a handgun on school premises. Planning for an emergency Every school district must have a multi hazard emergency operations plan, or an EOP, in the event of an active threat, severe weather or communicable diseases. EOPs must comply with the TEA’s standards for accessibility for students with impairments. Every three years, a...",2 days ago,1

"Microsoft is bringing Window's 11's slimmed-down updates to Windows 10, 
shedding megabytes for quicker upgrades","When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
Windows 10: trimmed updates for faster installs
Windows 10’s monthly updates will get a lot smaller, and therefore quicker to download and install, thanks to a feature that first debuted in Windows 11. Users with eligible devices can expect a decrease in update since the April 9, 2024 update which was 830 MB to around 630 MB with the latest update, released on April 23, 2024. 
The change was announced by Microsoft in a Windows blog post, writing that Windows 10 users will be getting a significant efficiency boost. Monthly Windows updates are typical for Windows 10 and Windows 11, and having to download bulky updates can be annoying and time consuming, especially for people with slower (or metered) internet connections. 
You can read more about what the shrunk-down update, KB5036979, will bring on Microsoft’s Support blog. Some of the developments that this update brings include account-related notifications (such as account activities, data backups, subscription management, and security settings) across the Start menu and Settings, an updated Widgets lock screen, a fix for a Bluetooth-related issue affecting certain wireless earbuds, an improved and more reliable Windows Search, as well as other quality-of-life updates. 

Microsoft explains that until now, Windows 11 cumulative updates were more efficiently packaged than those for Windows 10. This has now changed, with a reduction in the size of the monthly latest cumulative update (LCU) package.
If your device is running Windows 10, make sure you have done the following to make sure you’re ready for these new updates:
It’s good to see that Windows 10 users are still getting quality updates and that Microsoft is making adjustments to make them easier to install, especially as we approach Windows 10’s End-of-Life date on October 14, 2025. While I’m sure Windows 10 users appreciate that they’re still getting improved functionality, it remains sensible to prepare to update to Windows 11 (or whatever the next iteration of Windows is called which we expect to learn about soon).

India Election Live: Poll heats up after charged Modi comments about Muslims,Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker,LIVE51 minutes ago,1
"India election: fears that Modiâs BJP will polarise voters in fight for key 
state","Muslims worry Modi’s party will rely on familiar tactics of drawing on religious divisions as it battles Congress to to retain seats in Karnataka The sun scorched the carpeted car park at Mudipu Junction outside Mangalore in Karnataka state as volunteers arranged rows of red plastic chairs and placed mounds of biryani and fruit on the table for a public iftar, the moment Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. But this was no ordinary iftar. India is in the midst of a general election during which prime minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are seeking a third term, and factionalism is rife. The BJP, a formidably well-oiled machine, is going all out in Karnataka because it is the only state in south India where it has a foothold. Its presence in the other southern states is negligible. For a party with vaunting ambitions to reshape the political landscape for generations to come, this has frustrated the leadership. In the last general election in 2019, the BJP won 25 of Karnataka’s 28 seats. But the BJP may not be able to repeat such a decisive victory this time round; while the Congress party has languished in opposition for 10 years at a national level, it won a handsome victory in state elections last year. It is not yet clear whether BJP candidates will rely on the party’s familiar tactics of drawing on religious divisions and polarising voters, but given such high stakes the campaign has the potential to turn vicious. Amid such a climate, the organisers of the iftar decided, they said, to make a point of inviting Hindu and Christian residents in Mudipu to share the meal earlier this month. “The Hindu-Muslim polarisation in this area is so deep after decades of the BJP’s divisive politics that we thought we’d make it an iftar for everyone. Let us sit, eat, talk and remember we are all Indians,” said Ibrahim Mohammed, who has several businesses in the area. Among the non-Muslim attendees were Dr Sureka Shetty, a local Hindu gynaecologist, and Catholic nun Sister Philla. “I live here. I work here. I want to be on good terms with my Muslim neighbours and that’s why I accepted the invitation,” Shetty said, shouting to be heard over the sound of film music blaring from speakers. Mangalore is the main city in the beautiful coastal region of Karnataka. From a plane, the 200 miles of sandy beaches along the Arabian Sea, fringed by a forest of palm trees, stretch like an idyll. Yet this area has, since the 1990s, been a bastion of Hindutva, the BJP’s ideology of assertive nationalist Hinduism that seeks the establishment of a Hindu, rather than a secular, state. Dubbed the “Hindutva laboratory”, the coastal region has been a testing ground of sorts for the party to see how certain divisive policies play, from the banning of cow slaughter and halal to moves to ban Muslim traders from putting up stalls in Hindu temple fairs. Unlike north India where Muslims form 14% of the population, in Karnataka they comprise 24%. Mangalore is modern, wealthy and multicultural, thanks to the myriad influences of waves of traders over the centuries who arrived on its shores. The city is an education hub, full of schools and colleges set up by the church. But tensions remain beneath the surface, say residents. “It has a long history of communal violence. It takes nothing to provoke a flareup,” said local journalist Shivani Kava. The bishop of Mangalore, Peter Paul Saldanha, described the shocked reaction of a Christian teacher at the local school who was sacked at the behest of BJP politicians. They claimed the teacher, Sister Prabha, had insulted Hindu gods and “poisoned” children’s minds against Hinduism. Bishop Saldanha insisted that all she did was to recite a Rabindranath Tagore poem called Work is Worship in the English class. “We tried to persuade the management not to sack her until an investigation had been carried out but they sacked her anyway,” the bishop said.

Lok Sabha elections 2024: Indian PM Modi accused of hate speech,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, is now mainstream. Nobody has done more to advance this cause than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of India’s most beloved and polarizing political leaders. NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s main opposition party accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using hate speech after he called Muslims “infiltrators” — some of his most incendiary rhetoric about the minority faith, days after the country began its weekslong general election. The remarks at a campaign rally Sunday drew fierce criticism that Modi was peddling anti-Muslim tropes. The Congress party filed a complaint Monday with the Election Commission of India, alleging he broke rules that bar candidates from engaging in any activity that aggravates religious tensions. Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 Critics of the prime minister — an avowed Hindu nationalist — say India’s tradition of diversity and secularism has come under attack since his Bharatiya Janata Party won power a decade ago. They accuse the party of fostering religious intolerance and sometimes even violence. The party denies the accusation and says its policies benefit all Indians. At a rally in the state of Rajasthan, Modi said that when the Congress party was in government, “they said Muslims have the first right over the country’s resources.” If it returns to power, the party “will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children,” he said as the crowd applauded. “They will distribute it among infiltrators,” he continued, saying, “Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators?” Mallikarjun Kharge, the Congress party’s president, described the prime minister’s comments as “hate speech” and party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi called them “deeply, deeply objectionable.” The party sought action from the election commission, whose code of conduct forbids candidates from appealing “to caste or communal feelings” to secure votes. The first votes were cast Friday in the six-week election, which Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP are expected to win, according to most surveys. The results come out on June 4. Asaduddin Owaidi, a Muslim lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen party, said on Sunday: “Since 2002 till this day, the only Modi guarantee has been to abuse Muslims and get votes.” While there have long been tensions between India’s majority Hindu community and Muslims, rights groups say that attacks against minorities have become more brazen under Modi. Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs over allegations of eating beef or smuggling cows, an animal considered holy to Hindus. Muslim businesses have been boycotted, their homes and businesses have been bulldozed and places of worship set on fire. There have been open calls for their genocide. Modi’s remarks referred to a 2006 statement by then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Congress party. Singh said that India’s lower castes, tribes, women and, “in particular the Muslim minority” deserved to share in the country’s development equally. “They must have the first claim on resources,” Singh said. A day later, his office clarified that Singh was referring to all of the disadvantaged groups. In its petition to the election commission, the Congress party said that Modi and the BJP have repeatedly used religion and religious symbols and sentiments in their election campaign with impunity. “These actions have been further bolstered by the commission’s inaction in penalizing the prime minister and the BJP for their blatant violations of electoral laws,” it said. “In the history of India, no prime minister has lowered the dignity of his post as much as Modi has,” Kharge, Congress’ president, wrote on social media platform X. The commission can issue warnings and suspend candidates for a certain amount of time over violations of the code of conduct. “We decline comment,” a spokesperson for the commission told the Press Trust of India news agency on Monday. In his speech, Modi also repeated a Hindu nationalist trope that Muslims were overtaking the Hindu population by having more children. Hindus make up 80% of India’s 1.4 billion people, while the country’s 200 million Muslims are 14%. Official data shows that fertility rates among Muslims have dropped the fastest among religious groups in recent decades, from 4.4 in 1992-93 to 2.3 between 2019-21, just higher than Hindus at 1.94. Modi’s BJP has previously referred to Muslims as infiltrators and cast them as illegal migrants who crossed into India from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Several states run by the BJP have also made laws...",2 days ago,1

What phase 1 voter turnout says about BJP's chances at the polls,"The first and the largest phase of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections has registered an underwhelming voter turnout of around 66.1 per cent, which is a drop of nearly four percentage points compared to 2019. There is a decline in turnout in 19 of the 21 states, which had one or more seats going to polls in this phase. To enable us to arrive at a few distilled facts, we group the states in three categories: Hindi-speaking states, East and Northeast states and The Rest of India (Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and the Union Territories). (See Table 1). This grouping draws on certain common characteristics: For instance, in most of the Hindi-speaking states, the BJP has traditionally been strong with deep networks. In 2014, it won 35 out of the 36 seats from this group that went to polls in the first phase. In 2019, it won 29 out of 36. In Eastern and Northeastern States, the BJP had little presence pre-2014, but in the past decade, through acquisitions and partnerships with local parties, it has become the decisive force in the 18 seats that went to polls in the first phase. It and its coalition partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 16 of the 18 seats in 2019. In the Rest of India, the BJP/NDA is relatively weaker: it won just 10 out of the 48 seats in 2019 in these regions. The opposition is either a dominant force (Tamil Nadu) or a serious challenger (Maharashtra). We observe that the decline in turnouts in the first phase of 2024 is the highest in the Hindi-speaking states, followed by East and Northeastern States, followed by the rest of India. In fact, if we consider East and Northeast states without Nagaland, which faced an extraordinary situation of a poll boycott in six of its districts, the decline in turnout is the least (2.1pp). If we consider turnouts in this same set of seats longitudinally from 1999, we arrive at Table 2. It is salient that the trend in every successive election from at least 1999 has been an increase in combined turnout in these seats. 2024 breaks this trend. The trend for each group is also worth noting. For East and Northeast states, there has been an increase in turnouts every election, irrespective of the incumbent gaining or losing power. For the Rest of India group, the period when the United Progressive Alliance was voted into power — the 2004 and 2009 elections — the turnouts increased by a huge 12.4 pp. After 2009, both increases and declines in turnouts have been small. In Hindi-speaking states, the turnout declined in the two elections the UPA was voted into power, but it increased by a massive 14.2 pp in the two elections the NDA was voted into power. However, perhaps unexpectedly, the Hindi-speaking states have the highest decline in turnouts in the first phase of 2024: The BJP’s strongest suit seems to display weakness at least as far as turnouts are concerned. This observation is buttressed when we compare the turnout figures in seats where the NDA won in 2019 versus the seats where the Opposition INDIA bloc won in 2019. In 2019, the NDA won 50 out of 102 seats. In these seats, the turnout has dropped by 5.1 pp. The INDIA bloc won 49 seats in 2019. In these seats, the turnout has dropped by less than half of that in the NDA seats — by 2.4 pp. Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes | : Why voters’ silence is making the BJP nervous) There does seem to be a steeper drop in enthusiasm for voting in seats where the BJP has been strong. This observation is further supplemented by the data on the impact of the so-called double-engine sarkar on turnouts. In 2018, the BJP lost state elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In the 18 Lok Sabha seats from these states which have gone to polls in Phase 1, turnout percentages in the 2018 assembly elections were customarily high: 77.5 per cent in Madhya Pradesh and 76 per cent in Rajasthan. In the Lok Sabha elections that followed, turnouts dropped by just 2.6 pp in MP and 12.6 pp in Rajasthan, and the electorate who voted for the Opposition at the state-level decisively voted for the BJP in nationally. In 2023, the BJP won state elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. But in these 18 seats, turnouts have dropped by a massive 17.6 pp in Rajasthan and 13 pp...",1 day ago,1
Surat symptoms: On the BJP and the elimination of political contest,"To enjoy additional benefits
CONNECT WITH US
 April 25, 2024 12:20 am | Updated 07:40 am IST 
A malady that enfeebles Indian democracy — the elimination of contest, at the level of ideas, and political mobilisation — got a geographical tag in Surat, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate has been declared elected unopposed to the Lok Sabha. Democracy without an Opposition ceases to be one, but the ruling BJP has declared it as an objective in its slogan, a Congress-less India. Such an intent is in itself authoritarian, even if pursued through fair electoral means. What unfolded in Surat is far from fair: it was the foulest of tactics outside of any electoral play book. Signatories of Congress candidate Nilesh Kumbhani’s nomination papers declared on affidavit that their signatures were forged. All political parties routinely field a dummy candidate to deal with the unlikely event of the primary candidate’s death or rejection of nomination papers. In Surat, Suresh Padsala, who was fielded by the Congress as dummy, also had his nomination papers rejected after one of his proposers declared on affidavit that his signature too was forged. Eight other candidates withdrew their nominations, leaving the BJP candidate, Mukesh Dalal, as the only one standing. He was promptly declared the winner on April 22 by the Surat District Collector and also returning officer, and the BJP began celebrations. If at all the unopposed election of the BJP candidate signifies an absolute consensus among Surat’s nearly 17 lakh voters, it is a silence that speaks loudly about a serious illness in India’s democracy.
This elimination of contest through the misuse of state power, money, and misinformation has become a major threat to Indian democracy. Another candidate picked by the Congress in Gujarat not only left the party but also joined the BJP within a few days. Mr. Kumbhani’s proposers were his brother-in-law, nephew and a business partner, and the story of their forged signatures does not sit well in a functioning democracy. Mr. Kumbhani is not protesting either. He has gone incommunicado. Early this year, an election officer himself tampered with the ballot to declare the BJP candidate the winner in the Chandigarh mayoral election — a result which was overturned by the Supreme Court of India. It is unlikely that the contest would have been close in Surat, had it happened. The BJP had won the seat with massive margins in all Lok Sabha elections since 1989. Therefore, the point about the uncontested election of Mr. Dalal is the extermination of the Opposition rather than about his own victory. Contestations of ideas and their synergies over centuries have made India hospitable for democracy. The BJP needs to evolve a political culture in which disagreements with opponents are negotiated through fair contests.

Lok Sabha 2024: Key Faces In The Fray For Phase Two,"National Outlook looks at a few of the major players on the cards for Phase 2 of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. Following the first round of polls which saw a voter turnout of around approximately, 63%, the country is all set to walk into the second phase of Lok Sabha polls on Friday. The phase will see 89 seats across fourteen states and UTs go to polls promising a spate of high-voltage clashes and crucial contests with star campaigners and popular party faces entering the fray from both the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA blocs. Outlook looks at a few of the major players on the cards for Phase 2 of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. Rahul Gandhi (Wayanad, Congress): Seeking re-election from Wayanad, Congress MP and former President Rahul Gandhi enters the electoral fray in the second phase of the elections. Following a shocking loss in the hands of BJP’s Smriti Irani from Amethi in 2019, RaGa contested and secured a thumping win from Wayanad by a substantial margin. However, this year, Wayanad promises a high-voltage three-pronged clash with incumbent MP Gandhi pitted against CPI’s Annie Raja and BJP State President K Surendran, in a state which has seen Congress dominate since 2009 and no BJP MP ever nominated from the state. Follow Lok Sabha Elections 2024 Phase 2 LIVE Updates Arun Govil (Meerut, BJP): ​​Arun Govil, known for his portrayal of Lord Rama in the popular Ramayan TV series, is set to contest the polls in the second phase from Meerut, replacing three-time BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal who has been contesting from the seat since 2004. Govil was square off against Bahujan Samajwadi Party's (BSP) Devvrat Kumar Tyagi and Samajwadi Party's (SP) Sunita Verma. A star campaigner for BJP in its stronghold state, Govil, who joined the party in 2021, will look to secure a comfortable win in Meerut after BJP’s worrisome win margin in the 2019 elections. BY Outlook Entertainment Desk Hema Malini (Mathura, BJP): Another popular star-campaigner for BJP and two-time MP Hema Malini will be going into polls from Mathura in the second phase of the elections, looking to bag a third win on the trot. She is pitted against Mukesh Dhangar, a member of the All-India Congress Committee, and Suresh Singh of the BSP. Hema Malini bagged the seat for the first time in 2014, defeating the then-incumbent MP and National Chairman of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, Jayant Chaudhary and repeating the feat in 2014 against RLD’s Kunwar Narendra Singh. Shashi Tharoor (Thiruvananthapuram, Congress): Taking charge from the front, the Thiruvananthapuram seat has almost become synonymous with senior Congress leader, incumbent MP and a popular national face, Shashi Tharoor. Tharoor, who has been winning the seat since 2009, is set to contest against heavyweight BJP candidate and Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar and CPI’s Pannyan Raveendran. Following two consecutive CPI wins in the constituency, Tharoor has established himself as Congress’ force to reckon with in the state. BY Outlook Web Desk Om Birla (Kota, BJP): Incumbent Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla looks to establish Kota as a BJP stronghold in Rajasthan by winning the seat for the third time in a row. The seasoned BJP leader will go against Congress’ Prahlad Gunjal, in a bid to retain his presence in the Lower House. A veteran BJP presence in the state, he had served as an MLA in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly from the Kota South Assembly constituency between 2003 and 2014. Tejasvi Surya (Bangalore South, BJP): Incumbent MP from Bangalore South and the National President of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) since 2020, Tejasvi Surya is set to seek a second win from the constituency. Facing popular Congress candidate and general secretary of the All India Mahila Congress, Sowmya Reddy, Surya will look to echo his strong performance in 2019, where defeated Congress candidate B K Hariprasad with a margin of over three lakh votes. Poised to be a high-voltage clash of young and dynamic faces, Congress will hope to put a spanner in the works in what has been a BJP stronghold since 1991. Bhupesh Baghel (Rajnandgaon, Congress): The very seasoned Bhupesh Baghel, former chief minister of Chhattisgarh, is another major name on the cards for Congress in the second phase of polls. Contesting from the Rajnandgaon constituency, a BJP stronghold for over decades, Baghel, who served as the CM of Chhattisgarh between 2018 and 2013, squares off against incumbent MP BJP's Santosh Pandey who won by over a margin of...",9 hours ago,1
India elections 2024: Can Narendra Modi's BJP win in the south?,"A supporter of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds cutouts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election campaign where Modi speaks, in Bengaluru. Reuters A supporter of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds cutouts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election campaign where Modi speaks, in Bengaluru. Reuters “People here will never vote for Narendra Modi, he can never win in South India,” said Mohammad Sarfaraz, a resident of Hyderabad, the joint capital of India's southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. ""All he knows is to divide Hindus and Muslims."" The 55-year-old rickshaw driver was expressing his views on Mr Modi’s efforts to make inroads in the region that has historically rejected his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. “People want peace. Government must offer peace and not indulge in politics of religion,” Mr Sarfaraz told The National. As India undertakes the world’s largest elections, Mr Modi has been on whirlwind rallies in the country’s south. India’s southern region is made up of five states - Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The states have a combined population of 253 million people, as per the last census. They send 131 parliamentarians out of the total 543 to the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament. Mr Modi has confidently predicted that his ruling BJP will win 400 seats in a historic landslide. If his prediction comes true, it would be only the second time that a party won more than 400 seats, after the Indian National Congress - the main opposition to the BJP since 2014 - won 404 seats in 1984. But Mr Modi's goal relies on winning a significant number of seats in the southern states, away from the BJP's heartland in northern and Central India. The south of India has a strong regional identity, with its own history, culture, and languages, and provides a different challenge for the BJP. Mr Modi, who first came to power in 2014 and won again with an even bigger mandate in 2019, has his core base in Hindi-speaking economically poorer north India and Central India. The BJP has used religious sentiments to consolidate its Hindi-speaking Hindu vote bank in a region rife with religious and caste fault lines. But in the south, the BJP performed dismally in 2019. It won just 30 seats across all five southern states. In the southernmost Tamil Nadu, a crucial state with 39 seats, the BJP failed to win even a single seat. For his 2024 campaign, Mr Modi has made ten trips to Tamil Nadu. He has also used AI to translate his speeches from Hindi to the regional Tamil language. But experts predict Mr Modi will still struggle to make inroads in the state, due to his government’s divisive politics based on religion. In the last ten-year rule, the prime minister has espoused the cause of Hindutva or Hindu hegemony agenda. The BJP government has banned beef, popular in Kerala, and objected to students wearing hijab in Karnataka. Mr Modi has been accused of continuing to exploit religious tensions during his campaign, most recently when he described Muslims as ""infiltrators"". While polarisation has worked in the Hindi heartland, in South India it has been less effective. The multi-religious region is home to Hindus, Christians, and Muslims who have been living in relatively harmony for centuries. Unlike in northern India, where Muslims arrived in invading armies, Islam made its way to coastal southern India through Arab merchants and traders in the 7th century. Despite being a deeply religious region, with some of India's largest Hindu temples and the country’s oldest mosque, most southern Indians consider themselves part of a united Dravidian race and not divided along religious lines. “BJP has a huge challenge. One of the reasons is that these are not the states with Hindutva-driven politics. There is no space for BJP’s ideology,"" V Narayanan, a Chennai-based political analyst, told The National. ""The factors which helped it in the north like religion, are not the issues here. “The equation between the minorities, particularly Muslims and Hindus is far different here…they speak the local language and there is no big cultural divide,” he said. The five southern states contribute more than 30 per cent of India's GDP and are collectively more prosperous than the northern states.

The elections have been described by analysts as the most predictable polls India has held in decades, with prime minister Narendra Modi and his BJP widely expected to win a third term in power.

India election 2024 phase 2: Who votes and whatâs at stake?,"Across 13 states, 88 constituencies go to the polls on April 26 in the second phase of the world’s largest election.
The juggernaut of India’s mammoth parliamentary elections rolls into the second of seven phases on April 26 with all eyes on the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka.
The contenders in round two include a former leader of India’s main opposition who has never won a general election for his party, a former top United Nations official and author, and an erstwhile Bollywood star who is running for a third time but has disappointed her constituency by her absence on the ground.
India’s general elections for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, kicked off on April 19. The results of the world’s largest-ever democratic exercise are set to be announced on June 4.
With 969 million registered voters – or more than the combined population of the United States, the European Union and Russia – India has the largest electorate in the world.
Apart from numerous regional and national hopefuls, the two main alliances are the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and a coalition of 28 parties called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), led by the main opposition Indian National Congress, welded by the aim of unseating the BJP.

Voters from these 88 constituencies from 13 states and union territories will go to the ballot box:
Voting will start at 7am (01:30 GMT) and end at 6pm (12:30 GMT). Voters already in the queue by the time polls close will get to vote even if that means keeping polling stations open longer.
On April 19, 102 constituencies in 21 states voted in the first phase of the elections. Voting has concluded for all seats in Tamil Nadu, as well as Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Puducherry.
While voting took place for both of Manipur’s seats during phase one, Outer Manipur is heading to polls for a second time in phase two.
The third phase will be held on May 7.

"Lok Sabha election 2024: India votes in phase 2 as PM Modi pushes BJP's 
pro-Hindu line","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarization grows with Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign. The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh. (AP video: Shonal Ganguly) NEW DELHI (AP) — Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to galvanize voters with his assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics. People lined up outside polling stations as voting opened at 7 a.m. Turnout was expected to pick up as the day progresses. The outcome of Friday’s voting will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, as the 88 constituencies up for grabs across 13 states include some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties. Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi is running in Wayanad constituency in southern Kerala state for a second time, after he was defeated in 2019 elections by Smriti Irani, a BJP leader, in the northern Indian city of Amethi — a traditional stronghold for the Nehru-Gandhi family. Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 Other prominent candidates in the second phase of voting include Shashi Tharoor of the Congress party, popular BJP Bollywood star Hema Malini and actor Arun Govil, who played the role of Hinduism’s revered Lord Ram in a 1987 television adaptation of the ancient epic Ramayana. People queue up to vote during the second round of voting in the six-week-long national election near Palakkad, in Indian southern state of Kerala, Friday, April 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup) Prime Minister Modi urged people to vote in record numbers to strengthen democracy. “I especially urge our young voters and women voters to turn out in great numbers. Your vote is your voice!” Modi said in a message on the social media platform X. The BJP has already won one parliamentary seat from Surat in Gujarat state, where the Congress party candidate was disqualified Monday. Election officials said they found discrepancies in the signatures on the nomination and other candidates pulled out of the contest, leaving BJP nominee Mukesh Dalal as the winner by default. Nearly 970 million voters — more than 10% of the world’s population — will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election, which runs until June 1. The votes will be counted on June 4. There are a total of 28 states in India. The turnout of the first phase of polling on April 19 was estimated around 62% of 166.3 million eligible voters. About 160 million are eligible to vote in the second phase. By comparison, India’s 2019 national election registered the highest-ever voter turnout — 67.11% — in the history of Indian parliamentary elections. The turnout is expected to increase for five more rounds of voting. Voters’ relative apathy has surprised some political analysts, but they say that the BJP remains a front-runner. “You could argue that the listlessness is a consequence of a foregone conclusion,” said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian political scientist. “But for Modi’s party which is expecting to win 400 of the 543 seats the joyous surge is missing,” he said in an article in the Indian Express daily. Critics of the prime minister, an avowed Hindu nationalist, say India’s tradition of diversity and secularism has come under attack since the BPJ won power a decade ago. They accuse the party of fostering religious intolerance and sometimes even violence. The party denies the accusation and says its policies benefit all Indians. People stand in a queue to vote in Nahal village near Meerut, in Uttar Pradesh, India, Friday, April 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri) Modi stirred a huge controversy over the weekend when he said that the Congress party, if voted to power, would distribute the country’s wealth among “infiltrators” and “those who have more children,” in an apparent reference to the Muslim community.

"Lok Sabha elections 2024: Was unopposed election of MPs earlier 'death' of 
Constitution? Surat LS seat winner asks ...","Follow Us Surat: Surat MP-elect Mukesh Dalal, BJP's first candidate to be declared winner unopposed, has asked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi if the election of several other parliamentarians in the past without poll battle amounted to 'death' of the Constitution. In an interview with PTI on Wednesday, Dalal said the first lotus (BJP's poll symbol) has already bloomed in Surat during the ongoing elections and dedicated his win to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. This is the first step towards realising the PM's resolve of the NDA crossing the 400 Lok Sabha seat-mark, said the maiden candidate from the BJP to have ever won a parliamentary poll unopposed. Dalal on Monday became the first candidate in the last 12 years to have won a Lok Sabha election unopposed after all other nominees withdrew from the fray. The candidature of Congress' Nilesh Kumbhani was rejected a day earlier after the district returning officer prima facie found discrepancies in the signature of the proposers. This is the first victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the ongoing seven-phase Lok Sabha polls. Asked if his uncontested win deprived the people of Surat of their right to vote and select their representative, Dalal claimed the Congress was solely responsible for this situation. After Dalal's win, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi had in a post on X said, “Taking away the right of the people to choose their leader is another step towards destroying the Constitution of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. The ongoing Lok Sabha elections are not just to form a government but an election to save the country and to protect the Constitution.” On the Wayanad MP's comments, Dalal said, “I want to tell Rahul Gandhi, as per my information 28 MPs belonging to the Congress and other opposition parties have been so far declared elected unopposed. If my unopposed election is death of the Constitution, then was their election unopposed not death of democracy or death of the Constitution?"" “Secondly, I want to say that people of the entire country and Surat have not forgotten the insult of Modi community by Rahul Gandhi who had said that all Modis are thieves,' Dalal mentioned. The people of Surat were ready to take revenge by making the Congress candidate lose his deposit in the Lok Sabha polls, he said. Fearing a loss of face, the Congress candidate sought backdoor exit from the race,” claimed Dalal, who belongs to same Modh Baniya Ganchi community as PM Modi. “The Congress is solely responsible for the situation that has arisen in Surat,' he said. Dalal, who was earlier a corporator in the Surat Municipal Corporation, claimed the Congress allowed filing of nomination form in an irresponsible way and could not find three genuine proposers for its candidate. 'The Congress does not have four loyal workers who can be proposers, and the leader of that party wants to be the country's prime minister. If you think about the situation why people cannot vote here, the only responsible party is Congress,” he said. On allegations that the BJP was responsible for the rejection of Kumbhani's nomination form, Dalal said Surat is his party's stronghold since 1989. 'The BJP wanted to fight election in this seat with full force and party workers were ready to defeat the Congress candidate and even make him lose his deposit. Scared of the prospect of losing his deposit, the Congress candidate sought a backdoor exit to save his face,' he claimed. Dalal said after his candidature was announced, the party started an extensive campaign in Surat. 'We covered 70 per cent of the constituency in our campaign. We had public meetings in every assembly segment of the Lok Sabha constituency. The only disappointment for our party workers is that we had set the target of winning the seat by a margin of seven lakh votes, but now no election will take place,” he said. “First lotus has bloomed in Surat in the Lok Sabha polls. We dedicate this victory to PM Modi. This is our small step towards realising Prime Minister Modi’s resolve of ‘aabki bar, 400 par’,” said Dalal. The BJP leader said after the win, his priority will be to ensure smooth completion of the ongoing infrastructure projects, like the international airport for Surat, Metro rail, redevelopment of Surat railway station and bullet train project. 'I will help in resolving issues related to the textile and diamond industry of Surat,” he added. Meanwhile, a resident of Surat expressed unhappiness over being denied the...",1 day ago,1

India election: A visual guide to voting in the worldâs largest democracy,"
            A mammoth exercise in democracy is underway in India, where nearly a billion people will go to the polls over the next six weeks to vote in the world’s largest ever general election.
    

            Prime Minister Narendra Modi is standing for a rare third term in power, against an alliance of opposition parties that are seeking to unseat him.
    

            Here is a look at how the world’s most populous country votes in the world’s largest democracy.
    

            Home to more than 1.4 billion people, about 969 million are eligible to cast their vote in the upcoming election — more than the populations of North America and the European Union combined.
    

            This means about 12% of the world’s population will head to the polls, motivated by a range of issues from unemployment and welfare benefits to infrastructure and upholding democracy. The number of women registered to vote has increased by 40 million since the previous election in 2019, according to the election commission, while more than 20 million voters between ages 18-29 have been added to the electorate.
    

            Indians will be voting for 543 seats in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, with two other seats nominated by the country’s president.
    

            The party that wins a majority will appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister and form a ruling government.
    

            Voting begins on Friday, April 19, and will continue through June 1, with results announced on June 4.
    

            Some states only have one day to vote, while the country’s most populous state in the north, Uttar Pradesh, and the eastern states of Bihar and West Bengal with an estimated combined population of 475 million, will vote across a span of seven days.
    

            Here’s how and when the election takes place:
    

            From the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote forests in India’s central states, votes will be cast electronically across more than one million polling stations in the country — a 1.2% increase in the number of stations from the previous election in 2019.
    

            This operation requires some 15 million polling officials and security staff during the election, with some of these election workers traveling via road, boat, camel, train, and helicopters to reach India’s citizens.

What to Know About India's 2024 Election | TIME,"The world’s biggest election will take place next week when 960 million eligible voters from a population of 1.4 billion Indians cast their ballot to decide who will fill the 543 seats of the Lok Sabha, the more powerful lower house of Parliament—and who will become India’s next prime minister. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is competing against a coalition of more than a dozen opposition parties, including the Indian National Congress, which once ruled over the nation for more than 50 years. At the center of the contest is incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who first rose to power in 2014 on the promise of economic reform and a Hindu nationalist mandate. If he wins again, Modi will match the record of India’s first prime minister, the Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru, by staying in power for three consecutive terms. Read more: A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy Worldwide The election is a long and costly exercise: Voting begins on April 19, staggered in seven sequential phases over the course of six weeks, with the results announced on June 4. Similar to 2019, when India last held an election, this year’s election will see over a million polling booths set up across the country, with nearly 15 million polling personnel helping to administer the vote through electronic voting machines. All this is carefully planned and executed by the Election Commission of India. While the 2019 election, which cost $8.5 billion, was seen to be the world’s most expensive election by some estimates, this year’s vote is expected to exceed even that number. Below, everything you need to know about India’s next election. Following the British parliamentary system that was in place in India until the country’s independence in 1947, India’s democracy is a multiparty parliamentary system with a bicameral legislature. That means that the party or coalition of parties that wins a majority will form a government and nominate a candidate for prime minister. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must get 272 seats. Each of the seven voting phases is held on separate, single days during which several constituencies in multiple states cast their votes. The staggered polling enables India’s election commission to deploy security personnel who ensure the safety and freedom of electoral officials transporting the voting machines. The Indian Election Commission will count votes using a complex calculation system and verification. Once complete, the President of India Droupadi Murmu will invite the winning party to form a government and that party’s leader will be appointed prime minister. If no single party wins an outright majority, then the leading party will usually ally with other, smaller parties. The competition mainly lies between India’s two biggest political parties: the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Indian National Congress (INC). The BJP first came to power in 2014 under the leadership of current Prime Minister Modi, and now rules with a coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance. In the 2019 elections, the BJP enjoyed a landslide victory after clinching an absolute majority by 303 parliamentary seats. 73-year-old Modi, who first projected himself as an outsider with a heavy hand on rampant corruption, has since transformed into one of the most popular—and polarizing—leaders in the nation’s history. Polls suggest a comfortable win for Modi due to widespread support from the country’s Hindu majority. Read More: How Extreme Heat Will Impact India’s Election During his second term, Modi’s government struggled with COVID-19 pandemic mismanagement, high levels of unemployment, and increasing attacks against minorities and critics of the government. At the same time, Indians admire Modi’s efforts to propel India on the world stage, which has attracted significant foreign investment and U.S. support for India’s rivalry against neighboring China. Last August, India landed a rover on the moon, becoming the fourth country to achieve the space feat; a month later, New Delhi successfully hosted the G20 summit. In January, Modi also fulfilled his party’s long-held Hindu nationalist promise of opening a Hindu temple in the city of Ayodhya. The main challengers to Modi are Congress Party head Mallikarjun Kharge and party scion Rahul Gandhi, who attempted to capture the nation’s imagination by undertaking a “Unite India” march across the country last year. The INC has suffered two consecutive electoral defeats in the past, winning just 44 seats in 2014 and 52 seats in 2019. While campaigning for this year’s election it has also faced several setbacks, including bank accounts frozen by tax authorities. Last year, Gandhi was handed...",2 weeks ago,1

What would the results of a third term for Prime Minister Modi mean for India’s economy, democracy, and position in the Global South? Expert Brief by Manjari Chatterjee Miller April 2, 2024 1:15 pm (EST) India has a multiparty parliamentary government with a bicameral legislature. This year’s elections—set to begin April 19—are for India’s lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha, which has 543 seats. The party or coalition of parties that wins a majority will nominate a candidate for prime minister and form a ruling government. Currently, the BJP rules with a coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Recent opinion polls heavily favor the BJP, Modi, and many of their allies to remain in power. The main challenge to the BJP is led by the Indian National Congress, or “the Congress” as it is popularly known, which is the only other party with a cross-national appeal. However, the Congress lost dismally in the previous two national elections, held in 2014 and 2019. More on: India Elections and Voting Narendra Modi Religion Islam To contest the 2024 elections, the Congress has formed an alliance known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) with a large number of regional parties, such as the All India Trinamool Congress, the current government in the state of West Bengal. But the coalition could be cracking. The All India Trinamool Congress has objected to the Congress’s insistence on putting forth its own candidates for many seats, including in states such as West Bengal, where the Congress is less popular among voters. Furthermore, one of the architects of INDIA—the state of Bihar’s chief minister, Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) party—has defected to the BJP-led coalition. After the Election Commission of India completes the complex electoral calculations needed to decide who won the elections, the president of India will invite the winning party to form a government, and the party’s leader will be appointed prime minister. If no single party is able to win an outright majority, the leading party will form an alliance with smaller parties. As evident from the NDA and INDIA, alliances are often formed in advance of elections, though they can shift before or even after them. Modi is poised to remain the predominant face of the BJP, while politician Rahul Gandhi will likely represent the Congress party’s opposing coalition. This leaves voters (who cannot directly vote for either) with a binary choice between two representative figures. There are several significant issues in these elections, and they can often vary from state to state. Some major concerns for voters are: More on: India Elections and Voting Narendra Modi Religion Islam Unemployment. Across all of India, much buzz has been made of the country’s youth bulge, but many Indian youth are in fact left unemployed in a market that prioritizes highly skilled labor. At the end of 2023, the unemployment rate among youth ages 20–24 was 44.9 percent, while the overall unemployment rate stood at 8.7 percent. The economy. In agrarian states such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the rising debt of farmers and their subsequent protests has been an ongoing issue. More than 40 percent of India’s population is dependent on agriculture, and farmers feel left behind in India’s quest to raise living standards. Farmers’ demands include raising their stagnating incomes and setting price floors that guarantee farmers a 50 percent profit from government purchases of certain crops. The health of the Indian economy is also at stake. On one hand, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8 percent in 2023. But on the other, economists have argued that this growth does not accurately...",3 weeks ago,1
Will NDA Achieve '400 Paar'? What Poll Of Opinion Polls Shows,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File). The Bharatiya Janata Party is expected to win a third consecutive term - but fall well short of its 'abki baar, 400 paar' target - in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, according to NDTV's poll of opinion polls. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is expected to win 372 of the 543 contested seats, and the Congress-led INDIA could get 122, with the remaining 49 going to parties not allied with either side. The predicted final result may not be a surprise, given the NDA - its charge led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a third consecutive time - is already seen by many as the clear winner, but the numbers suggest a narrowing of the gap between the ruling party and the opposition since 2019. Health Warning: Opinion polls often get it wrong. The 365 seats the NDA is expected to win this year represents a 3.4 per cent increase over its 2019 result; it won 353 seats (the BJP got 303) and the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance) got 90. The NDA's 2019 score was five per cent up from the 336 it won in the 2014 election. The BJP's primary rival - the UPA in 2014 and 2019 and INDIA in 2024 - went from 60 in 2014 to 90 in 2019, an increase of 50 per cent. In this election INDIA's expected return of 122 is a 35 per cent jump. The data from the poll of opinion polls is drawn from nine polls, including three conducted by ABP-C Voter on December 25, March 12, and April 16. In these three, the NDA's expected score jumps from 295-335 to 366 and settles at 373, while INDIA goes from 163 down to 156 and then 155. The biggest predicted returns for the BJP-led alliance comes from Times-ETG, which gives it between 358 and 398 seats, and gives INDIA 110-130. The non-aligned parties are given 64-68 seats here. India TV-CNX, Zee News-Matrize, and Times-Matrize all give the NDA over 350 seats each, and give INDIA less than 100 seats. The exception is Times Matrize, which gives the bloc 104 seats. The closest prediction is India Today-C Voter; a sample of nearly 36,000 voters polled on February 8 indicates a return of 335 for the NDA, 166 for the INDIA, and 42 for other opposition parties. The NDA is predicted to ride to victory on the back of clean sweeps in eight states and union territories, including national capital Delhi, Mr Modi's home state of Gujarat, and Arunachal Pradesh in the northeast, where the BJP has flexed its nationalist muscles in the wake of Chinese aggression. The NDA is also tipped to sweep Rajasthan - building on last year's Assembly election win - Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu. Together, these states and UTs send 72 MPs to the Lok Sabha. Winning these, if that is what happens, will give the BJP a significant edge in the final tally, particularly since the opinion polls suggest, as is widely expected, the saffron party will once again fail to impress in South India. In the 2019 election the BJP swept Delhi (seven seats), Gujarat (26), Arunachal Pradesh (two), Chandigarh (one), Uttarakhand (five), Himachal Pradesh (four), and Daman and Diu (one). The party also claimed 24 of Rajasthan's 25 seats; the 25th went to an ally. As expected, the BJP and allies will likely thump rivals in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh. Of the 149 seats in play here, the NDA could win a massive 137. That return, if true, will almost match its 2019 score; it won 39 of Bihar's 40 seats, 74 of UP's 80 and 28 of Madhya Pradesh's 29. In Bihar, where the opposition suffered a huge setback this year after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar - one of the bloc's founders - returned his Janata Dal (United) to the NDA, INDIA may win only five. In UP - where the 80 Lok Sabha seats are by far the highest of any state - INDIA must prepare for a rout, the opinion polls indicate. And in Madhya Pradesh the Congress will win just one seat. The battle between the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance and the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance in Maharashtra, and the BJP's high-tension clash with the Trinamool in Bengal, will likely end with an advantage for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party. The Mahayuti could dominate Maharashtra - winning 30 of its 48 seats - and, in Bengal,...",1 week ago,1

India Lok Sabha election 2024: Who votes in phase 1 and whatâs at stake?,"A total of 102 constituencies in 21 states will vote on April 19 for the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections.
The first of seven phases of the Indian national election is set to kick off on April 19. These elections are for the 543 seats of the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of parliament. The party or coalition that secures a majority of the seats in the Lok Sabha will form the next government.
It is the world’s – and history’s – largest ever democratic exercise, with 969 million registered voters eligible to cast their vote using 5.5 million electronic voting machines over 44 days. The votes will be counted and results will be announced on June 4.
As a multiparty democracy, India’s elections will see a range of national and regional parties competing for votes. But two principal coalitions are directly facing off as contenders to lead the nation: the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and a coalition of 26 parties, called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), led by the main opposition, the Indian National Congress.
In the first phase, 102 constituencies within 21 states and union territories are voting, including:

Voting will start at 7am local time (01:30 GMT) and end at 6pm local time (12:30 GMT). Voters in the queue by closing time get to vote even if that means keeping polling booths open longer.

Lok Sabha election 2024: India begins voting in mammoth polls,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Indians are casting ballots in the first round of voting across 21 states. Voting will take place over a six-week period and votes will be counted on June 4. NEW DELHI (AP) — Millions of Indians began voting Friday in a six-week election that’s a referendum on Narendra Modi, the populist prime minister who has championed an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics and is seeking a rare third term as the country’s leader. People began queuing up at polling stations hours before they were allowed in at 7 a.m. in the first 21 states to hold votes, from the Himalayan mountains to the tropical Andaman Islands. Nearly 970 million voters — more than 10% of the world’s population — will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered elections that run until June 1. The votes will be counted on June 4. This election is seen as one of the most consequential in India’s history and will test the limits of Modi’s political dominance.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) If Modi wins, he’ll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term, after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister. Most polls predict a win for Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, who are up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties. It’s not clear who will lead India if the opposition alliance, called INDIA, wins the election. Its more than 20 parties have not put forward a candidate yet. The BJP controls much of India’s Hindi-speaking northern and central parts, but is now trying to gain a foothold in the east and south. Their toughest challenge is in the southern Tamil Nadu state, with 39 seats, where voting is being held Friday. Voters in hot and humid Chennai, the state’s capital, began briskly filling the city’s nearly 4,000 polling booths. A number of them said they were voting for a change in federal government given rising prices, unemployment and religious polarization stoked by the BJP.

(AP Photo/Altaf Qadri) “First thing I came to vote for is to have a country without any religious disharmony. In Tamil Nadu — Hindus, Muslims, Christians, we’re all together. And this unity should grow,” said 65-year-old Mary Das, who was waiting to vote. P. Chidambaram, an opposition Congress party leader and the country’s former finance minister, said that the people of Tamil Nadu would not vote for the BJP as “it is imposing one language, one culture, one system and one kind of food.” The BJP has long struggled to capture votes in the state, where two powerful regional parties — the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam — dominate. The BJP drew a blank in 2019, and won one seat in 2014. In Rajasthan, people returning from polling stations covered their heads against dusty winds. “If the new government is able to solve unemployment, then it will be good. People are migrating from this region to earn a living,” said Atinder Singh, 26.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup) Voting is also taking place in the northeastern state of Manipur, where a near-civil war for a year has triggered ethnic violence. Mobs have rampaged through villages and torched houses, and more than 150 people have been killed. The election comes after a decade of Modi’s leadership, during which the BJP has consolidated power through a combination of Hindu-first politics and economic development. Modi has ratcheted up Hindu nationalist rhetoric on the campaign trail, and has sought to present himself as a global leader. His ministers tout him as the steward of a surging India, while his supporters celebrate his campaign promise to make India a developed nation by 2047, when it marks 100 years of independence. But while India’s economy is among the world’s fastest-growing, many of its people face growing economic distress. The opposition alliance is hoping to tap...",6 days ago,1
"In face of Modi juggernaut, Indiaâs opposition appears increasingly weak","Under the searing New Delhi sun, more than a dozen of India’s top opposition leaders joined hands in a rare show of unity imploring voters to “save democracy.” Standing before thousands of supporters at the city’s historic and politically important Ramlila Maidan, the March 31 rally marked the opposition’s strongest attempt yet to sway voters against electing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third straight term. The consequence of continued Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule, they say, would be the erosion of the very foundation upon which modern India was built: democracy. “This election is for saving democracy and we must fight united,” main opposition party Indian National Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told the crowds, who were waving the party flag of orange, white and green. “There is no level playing field in this election.” Related article What to know about the world’s biggest election It echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election – ending the 10-year rule of India’s powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi. Gandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India’s future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India’s democracy was saved. To many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows. “Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,” Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan. Unless there is a major upset, Modi’s BJP is set to win its third straight five-year term thanks to his potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism. According to 2023 Pew research, about eight in 10 Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world. But India’s opposition leaders accuse Modi’s right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4. They also warn Modi’s brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting. Modi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a “process of law” to take “appropriate action against corruption.” To counter the BJP, the opposition has formed a 27-member bloc — the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA. But so far that alliance has proved lackluster, observers say. It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate. “What kind of a democracy can you have if you don’t have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?” asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist. “That’s why it’s not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it’s a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.” Among those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power. He is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India’s first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country’s founding prime minister. “If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,” Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month. The BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India’s parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India’s constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and – crucially – secularism. The BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution....",5 days ago,1
Will Modi win 400 seats in Indiaâs election? The south holds the answer,"As the first phase of voting kicks off on April 19, Modi’s dreams of a record win hinge on a part of the country that has traditionally been immune to the BJP’s charms. New Delhi, India – In the early part of his campaign for India’s upcoming 2024 election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a target for his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance that is ambitious even by the standards of his successful coalition. “Abki baar 400 paar,” Modi declared, claiming that the National Democratic Alliance, the ruling group of parties, would cross the 400-seat mark in a house of 543 parliamentary seats, with the BJP alone winning 370. Only once in India’s 77 years as an independent nation has any party or alliance won more than 400 seats: the now-in-opposition Congress Party in 1984, in the aftermath of the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Yet, with India poised to hold the first phase of its 44-day, seven-stage election on April 19, analysts say the success of Modi’s calculations could hinge on one significant part of the country, which has so far remained largely impervious to the BJP’s Hindu majoritarian charms: the country’s south. Home to about 20 percent of the nation’s population, the five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana, and the union territories of Puducherry and Lakshadweep, constitute India’s most economically prosperous region. The south contributes more than 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). But despite Modi’s pitch that his government has helped boost the Indian economy, the BJP won just 30 of the 131 seats from the region – the vast majority of them from one state, Karnataka – in 2019. It drew a blank in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, and lost the constituencies of Puducherry and Lakshadweep. Some analysts believe a repeat is inevitable. Nationally, the BJP won 303 out of 543 seats, almost maxing out in most northern states – its traditional strongholds – and leaving the south as the territory it likely needs to gain in for the party to win a larger mandate than in 2019. “BJP is very unpopular in Andhra Pradesh and other southern states. In fact, anyone that allies with the BJP will do badly in these elections,” said Mohan Guruswamy, a political analyst and the chairman of the Centre for Policy Analysis (CPA), a New Delhi-based think tank. Parakala Prabhakar, an economist and the husband of India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said the coming election would reflect a “north-south divide”. Prabhakar has been a critic of the government his wife is a key member of. The BJP’s struggles in India’s south are not new. With substantially better development indices, including on education and health, than the north, the region has been relatively immune to the religion-driven politics that have traditionally characterised the BJP. The southern state of Kerala, for instance, has an infant mortality rate of six deaths out of every 1,000 births– almost on par with the United States. The figure for the BJP-ruled state of Madhya Pradesh on the other hand stands at 48, a rate similar to that of war-torn Afghanistan. Those relative development gains make the BJP’s Hindu majoritarian Hindutva ideology less of a draw in the south, said Prabhakar. Kishore Chandra Deo, a former federal minister who resigned in February from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a regional force in the state of Andhra Pradesh, after it decided to ally with the BJP in the 2024 election, agreed. “In North India, it is possible to bring about religious consolidation whereas in the south, it is not possible,” Deo said. “Here, the Ram temple is not an issue,” he added, referring to the temple to the Hindu god Ram consecrated by Modi in January, in the city of Ayodhya. The temple was built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque, which was demolished by hardline Hindu activists in December 1992. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, the Tamil Nadu minister for information technology and digital services, who until recently was the state’s finance minister, echoed Deo’s view. “The south has a tradition of harmonious co-existence between all religions going back several hundred years. Attempts at communal polarisation will definitely backfire in the south,” Rajan told Al Jazeera. That hypothesis is now about to be tested – starting on Friday. Despite its traditional struggles there, the BJP and Modi have been trying hard to break through in the state of Tamil Nadu, which, with 39...",1 week ago,1
âInfiltratorsâ: Modi accused of anti-Muslim hate speech amid India election,"The Indian PM turned to old anti-Muslim tropes in an election rally, potentially signalling a shift in his campaign strategy, say analysts. New Delhi, India — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing accusations of spreading hatred against Muslims after controversial comments on Sunday wherein he equated the community to “infiltrators” and peddled anti-Muslim tropes in the middle of the country’s general elections. Speaking at a crowded rally in the western state of Rajasthan, Modi said if the opposition led by the Congress party came to power, it would distribute the country’s wealth among “those who have more children”, in an apparent reference to Muslims, whom he had spoken about just before. “Should your hard-earned money be given to infiltrators?” he said to the cheering crowd, before alleging that the opposition would take away even mangalsutras — the auspicious necklace that a husband ties around his wife’s neck in Hindu weddings — if given a chance. Local poll officials in Rajasthan confirmed to Al Jazeera that they had received at least two complaints against Modi, calling for his election campaign to be suspended and for his arrest. Renu Poonia, a nodal officer of the Election Commission of India (ECI) in the state capital, Jaipur, revealed that the complaints were received from the Azad Adhikar Sena, a regional political party, and a local non-profit organisation. India’s election code bars parties and politicians from engaging in speeches and campaigns that aim to perpetuate religious or caste differences. But independent watchdogs and activists have long complained that election officials act too slowly, if at all, especially when cases involve powerful officials in the government. Many leaders in Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies in India’s Hindu-majoritarian right have long portrayed the country’s 200 million Muslims effectively as outsiders. Muslim asylum seekers and refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar are in particular targeted as “infiltrators”. The BJP and its partners have also long pushed a conspiracy theory that suggests that Indian Muslims produce more children intending to eventually outnumber Hindus in the country. In reality, government data shows that the Muslim fertility rate in India is dropping the fastest among all communities and has almost halved in the past three decades. Modi has himself promoted this stereotype — in 2002, after an anti-Muslim massacre in the state of Gujarat, where he served terms as chief minister — infamously mocking relief camps as baby-producing factories. Yet, in recent years, while others in his party and its coalition partners have often engaged in open Islamophobic commentary and even violence, Modi has focused on his government’s claimed accomplishments in the fields of the economy and social development. That had been the principal thrust of his 2024 re-election campaign too. Until now. Asim Ali, a political commentator, said Modi’s remarks were “the most inflammatory statement by a sitting prime minister in the recent history of India” and marked a significant shift in his election pitch. India is poised to vote in the second of seven phases of its national election on Friday, April 26. The first phase of voting was held on April 19. “Five years ago, the question was why is Modi not reigning in extremist voices; now, PM Modi is the most extremist campaigner,” said Ali. In his speech, Modi said he was referring to the Congress election manifesto, which promises wealth redistribution amid growing concerns over inequality, and to past statements by the opposition party. “When they [the Congress] were in power, they said Muslims have first right over resources. They will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children,” Modi said. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Congress had said India’s traditionally marginalised communities, including castes that had faced historical discrimination and religious minorities, “particularly Muslims”, should have the first claim on the nation’s resources. Singh’s comment had followed a report by a government-appointed panel under a former judge that had found that the social, economic and educational conditions of Indian Muslims were worse than those of any caste or community. Modi’s comments, some analysts and common Muslims said, could instigate hate-fuelled violence against Muslims — already a problem that has skyrocketed under the current government’s decade-long reign. “The PM might have said it as a jibe against the Congress, but eventually this will further perpetuate the stereotype of Muslims as a problem, and not an asset for India,” said Zeyad Masroor Khan, journalist and author of City on Fire, a book on an anti-Muslim riot...",3 days ago,1
India election: Hindu nationalism mainstream after Modiâs decade in power,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, is now mainstream. Nobody has done more to advance this cause than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of India’s most beloved and polarizing political leaders. AHMEDABAD, India (AP) — Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, is now mainstream. Nobody has done more to advance this cause than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of India’s most beloved and polarizing political leaders. And no entity has had more influence on his political philosophy and ambitions than a paramilitary, right-wing group founded nearly a century ago and known as the RSS. “We never imagined that we would get power in such a way,” said Ambalal Koshti, 76, who says he first brought Modi into the political wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the late 1960s in their home state, Gujarat. Modi was a teenager. Like other young men — and even boys — who joined, he would learn to march in formation, fight, meditate and protect their Hindu homeland. A few decades earlier, while Mahatma Gandhi preached Hindu-Muslim unity, the RSS advocated for transforming India — by force, if necessary — into a Hindu nation. (A former RSS worker would fire three bullets into Gandhi’s chest in 1948, killing him months after India gained independence.) Modi’s spiritual and political upbringing from the RSS is the driving force, experts say, in everything he’s done as prime minister over the past 10 years, a period that has seen India become a global power and the world’s fifth-largest economy. At the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks against minorities — particularly Muslims — from hate speech to lynchings. India’s democracy, critics say, is faltering as the press, political opponents and courts face growing threats. And Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state. At 73, Modi is campaigning for a third term in a general election, which starts Friday. He and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are expected to win. He’s challenged by a broad but divided alliance of regional parties. Supporters and critics agree on one thing: Modi has achieved staying power by making Hindu nationalism acceptable — desirable, even — to a nation of 1.4 billion that for decades prided itself on pluralism and secularism. With that comes an immense vote bank: 80% of Indians are Hindu. “He is 100% an ideological product of the RSS,""in said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, who wrote a Modi biography. “He has delivered their goals.” Youth and children participate in Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)'s shakha in Ahmedabad, India, April 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Ajit Solanki) Between deep breaths under the night sky in western India a few weeks ago, a group of boys recited an RSS prayer in Sanskrit: “All Hindus are the children of Mother India ... we have taken a vow to be equals and a promise to save our religion.” More than 65 years ago, Modi was one of them. Born in 1950 to a lower-caste family, his first exposure to the RSS was through shakhas — local units — that induct boys by combining religious education with self-defense skills and games. By the 1970s, Modi was a full-time campaigner, canvassing neighborhoods on bicycle to raise RSS support. “At that time, Hindus were scared to come together,” Koshti said. “We were trying to unite them.” The RSS — formed in 1925, with the stated intent to strengthen the Hindu community — was hardly mainstream. It was tainted by links to Gandhi’s assassination and accused of stoking hatred against Muslims as periodic riots roiled India. For the group, Indian civilization is inseparable from Hinduism, while critics say its philosophy is rooted in Hindu supremacy. Today, the RSS has spawned a network of affiliated groups, from student and farmer unions to nonprofits and vigilante organizations often accused of violence. Their power — and legitimacy — ultimately comes from the BJP, which emerged from the RSS. “Until Modi, the BJP had never won a majority on their own in India’s Parliament,” said Christophe Jaffrelot, an expert on Modi and the Hindu right. “For the RSS, it is unprecedented.” In this May 20, 2014 file photo, before being elected as prime minister for the first time, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narendra Modi, bends down on his knees on the steps of the Indian parliament building as a sign of respect as he arrives for the BJP parliamentary party meeting in New Delhi, India....",1 week ago,1
India heads to the polls in worldâs biggest election,"Follow: Polls opened Friday in the first and largest phase of India’s marathon election, in which populist Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term and deepen his historic transformation of the world’s most populous nation. About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest democratic exercise in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks. Votes will be counted on June 4. It is considered among the most consequential votes in decades, with Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking an outright majority in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. An emphatic win for the BJP would give the party a mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, pulling away from India’s secular foundation toward majoritarian rule. Opposing the BJP juggernaut is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, including India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which are campaigning to reduce inequality and uphold what they say are India’s at-risk democratic institutions. Throughout its decade in power, the BJP has come under scrutiny from rights groups for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent and democratic freedoms. Yet Modi and his party have been buoyed by levels of popularity not seen in decades. According to 2023 Pew research, about eight-in-ten Indian adults have a favorable view of the prime minister. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has overseen massive infrastructure spending, building highways, power plants and maritime projects, as well as subsidizing the construction of millions of concrete homes for improvised families. Related article Billions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet. What to know about the world’s biggest election “The BJP has developed the country significantly in the past ten years. Corruption and crime has decreased drastically. What more can we ask for?” Aditya Garg, 29, told CNN from a voting station in Muzaffarnagar, in Uttar Pradesh. Under Modi’s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power. Despite these successes, soaring youth unemployment and inequality remain stubbornly persistent problems, particularly in rural areas, and critics say Modi has driven religious polarization, which has included rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country’s 230 million Muslims. Modi has walked a fine line geopolitically, placing India as a crucial counterpoint between global powers, and the Unites States, Russia and China will be watching the election closely. As polls opened Friday, the leader had a message for voters. “I urge all those voting in these seats to exercise their franchise in record numbers,” he wrote on X. Modi has set an ambitious target to secure a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP – up from 303 in 2019 – and the others from its National Democratic Alliance. The BJP’s campaign manifesto centers on job creation and anti-poverty and development programs, with particular focus on women, the poor, young people and farmers. Modi wants to turn India into a global manufacturing hub, continue its massive infrastructure transformation, and achieve energy independence by 2047. Worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, India is the world’s fifth largest economy, having jumped four spots in the rankings during his decade in office. Modi has pledged that India will have the world’s third largest economy during a possible third term. However, economic successes have been slow to trickle down to the country’s poorest and India’s gross domestic product (GDP) per person is ranked a lowly 147 in 2022, according to the World Bank. “Everything has become so expensive; how can poor people survive in this climate? I think it’s time for a change,” said Irafan Mohammad, a Muzaffarnagar rickshaw driver, who has four children and earns $6 a day. Modi wants India to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, will push to bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics and aims to land an astronaut on the moon, and has pledged to transform the country into a developed nation by 2047. Challenging him is the country’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, a party instrumental ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule and one that has governed for much of its independent history. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance, unable to break through the popularity of India’s incumbent leader.

What to know about the worldâs biggest election","Follow: The world’s biggest election kicks into gear next week when the first ballots are cast in India’s mammoth national polls, considered the most consequential in decades with the potential to shape the country’s future. Nearly 1 billion people are eligible to decide whether to grant Prime Minister Narendra Modi a rare third consecutive term in office and extend the 10-year rule of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Under Modi, India has become the world’s fastest growing major economy, pushing the country of 1.4 billion people to near-superpower status. But India has also become increasingly polarized along religious lines and critics say another five-year term will give Modi’s right-wing BJP a mandate to continue its policies that have transformed the country from a secular republic to a Hindu-first nation. Here’s what you need to know about the largest election in human history: India’s national elections are a giant exercise in democracy and logistics that take over a month to complete. About 968 million people are eligible to vote — more than the populations of the United States, the European Union and Russia combined. Given the size of the electorate, there isn’t a single date when everyone will vote. Instead, polling will unfold over seven phases around the country, beginning on April 19 and ending on June 1. All the votes from the country’s 28 states and eight union territories will be counted and results released on June 4. Under a multi-party, first-past-the-post system, Indians will vote to fill 543 of 545 seats in the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, with two other seats nominated by the country’s president. The party with the majority will form a government and appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister. Modi and his BJP remain hugely popular and he is widely expected to secure another five years in power. The 73-year-old was first elected prime minister in 2014 with a roaring majority on a ticket of development and anti-corruption. He is credited with implementing welfare and social reforms, and easily secured a second term in 2019, this time on a more apparent platform of Hindu nationalism. In that election more than 67% of Indians cast their ballot — the highest voter turnout in the country’s history. The main challenger to the BJP is the Indian National Congress, which has governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence but now finds itself in the doldrums. In an effort to prevent another Modi win, the Congress formed an alliance with other opposition leaders, including major regional parties. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, launched its campaign late last month on a platform of “saving democracy.” Political scion Rahul Gandhi is the face of the Congress party but other key figures include popular leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. There are also regional heavyweights such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress’ Mamata Banerjee and the south’s Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, who will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states where Modi is yet to break through. The INDIA bloc has been beset by infighting and is yet to put forward its candidate for prime minister. Analysts say it is struggling to match the kind of star quality and appeal projected by Modi. The opposition is also under pressure from what it says is a campaign by the BJP to weaken Modi’s opponents. Several prominent members of the opposition, including Delhi chief minister Kejriwal, have been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties. The Congress had its bank accounts frozen by federal tax authorities and said it was asked to pay a further $218 million in taxes. The BJP has denied political interference. Meanwhile, another victory for Modi would cement his place as one of India’s most important and longest-serving leaders. Modi’s party and its allies are aiming to win more than 400 seats in the Lok Sabha — giving them enough votes to change India’s constitution. That figure will also improve its absolute majority secured in 2019 when the BJP won 303 seats, to the Congress party’s 52. India is the world’s largest democracy but over a decade of BJP rule, analysts say the populist Modi has tightened his grip on its democratic institutions. Minorities, especially the country’s 200 million Muslims, say they have been persecuted under the BJP’s Hindu-nationalist policies. And Modi...",2 weeks ago,1
"Can Sunil Kanugolu bring Indiaâs Modi down, 10 years after helping him win?","One of India’s foremost election war room generals, Sunil Kanugolu operates from the shadows. But Modi isn’t his only challenge: His own party, Congress, isn’t helping his campaign, either. A small crack in one of the pillars supporting the world’s largest lift-irrigation project was the opening that Sunil Kanugolu was looking for as he shepherded the election campaign of the opposition Congress party in the southern Indian state of Telangana late last year. Up against the regional Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) party whose leader K Chandrashekhar Rao had ruled Telangana since the state’s birth a decade earlier, the Congress, riding on disenchantment over alleged corruption and nepotism, was polling well. But Kanugolu, the in-house election mastermind of the Indian National Congress or Congress party, wanted something more — something that would drive home his party’s advantage, based on a mantra that’s central to his approach. “No election is ever won by logic. Emotions win elections,” the 40-year-old says often, according to a close confidant who requested anonymity. In Telangana, a member of Kanugolu’s team found a photograph of the small crack in the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project that morphed into a poll strategy to topple the BRS from power. Mock ATM machines, branded as “Kaleshwaram ATM”, were set up in different parts of Telangana and photos of Congress workers inserting fake currency notes into the slot — which was the chief minister’s mouth — went viral. In the story that the Congress was telling, the project, constructed at a staggering cost of $9.8bn and being touted as a symbol of Telangana pride, was a crumbling testament to the BRS’ brazen corruption. The campaign was a classic example from Kanugolu’s election strategy playbook. “I’m not a believer in fighting elections with multiple, three-four-five items. There has to be one single narrative that you keep pushing and get the entire party, entire ecosystem, resources at your disposal to rally around. Other issues are sprinklings that you add to speeches and stuff like that,” Kanugolu’s confidant recalls him saying. In Telangana, that “sprinkling” included publicising welfare schemes the Congress would implement for women, farmers, youth, the elderly and poor families if voted to power. “Within about a week there was a three to nine percent swing in the vote share on the basis of the promises,” a researcher with Inclusive Minds, the Bengaluru-headquartered election consultancy firm that Kanugolu runs for the Congress, told Al Jazeera. The Congress won a clear majority and formed the government in Telangana. A decade ago, Kanugolu, a former consultant with McKinsey, was a member of the team that strategised, shaped and implemented Narendra Modi’s prime ministerial campaign. Now, a decade later, he is one of the top political consultants in the country and is working with the Congress to bring down PM Modi in the national elections that began on April 19 with the first phase of voting, and will be conducted in seven phases ending on June 1. But the challenge Kanugolu faces is not just from Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but his own Congress party as well. The Congress party has been out of power federally for 10 years, and has just 52 members of parliament (MPs) in the 543-member lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha. In May 2022, when Kanugolu officially joined the Congress, he was inducted into an eight-member “Task Force-2024”. The plan was to let him lead the Congress’s campaigns in nine states that went to polls for their regional governments in 2023 — and then tackle the 2024 general elections. But internal politics within the Congress derailed the state election plan and the task force failed to take off, forcing Kanugolu to narrow his focus and ambition. He is now working on a plan B, focussing on 100-120 constituencies where the Congress either has a winning chance or wants to put up a fight as a matter of prestige. The general hired to win India’s 2024 election war by launching a full-frontal attack on Modi’s BJP is now busy managing a hundred or so snipers and trying to make sure they don’t miss their targets. “Political consultants are not magicians. They play an important but limited role if a party is in good shape,” Sanjay Kumar, co-director of Lokniti, a New Delhi-based research organisation that studies public opinion during and between elections, told Al Jazeera. “Is there a magician who can make the Congress win the 2024 elections? Even 50 magicians can’t make the Congress win.” Ahead...",1 week ago,1

"Six weeks, 969 million voters, 2,600 parties: Indiaâs mammoth election 
explained","The world’s most populous country prepares to go to the polls, with Narendra Modi’s BJP the frontrunner in vote that ends on 1 June India, home to more than 1.4 billion people, will begin its mammoth election on 19 April. The country prides itself on the scale of its parliamentary elections, ensuring that even those in the remotest corners and highest peaks of the vast country are able to cast their vote. Voting machines in such less accessible parts are carried on the backs of horses and elephants and for some, polling booths can be reached only by boat. India also boasts the world’s highest polling booth, 15,256ft (4,650 metres) up in the Himalayan mountains. Due to its colossal geography, voting is not on a single day but is instead split into seven phases across the different states, lasting nearly six weeks in total. It will take place using electronic machines in more than a million polling booths, and the Election Commission of India will deploy 15 million people to oversee the operation. Voting will close on 1 June and results will finally be counted and declared on 4 June. India’s elections are also some of the most expensive in the world. This year, the cost is expected to hit 1.2tn rupees (£12bn), which is almost double what was spent in the 2019 elections. This time round India will have 969 million eligible voters – more than 10% of the world’s population. They represent the largest electorate anywhere and will include 18 million first-time voters. More than 2,600 political parties are registered in this election. According to most analysts and political polling, the frontrunner is India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) which has been in power since 2014 and is seeking a third term. The Hindu nationalist policies of Modi and the BJP government are widely seen to have reshaped the political and cultural landscape of the country over the past decade, shifting it away from the secularism enshrined in the constitution – which guarantees equality for all religions – and towards Hindu majoritarian rule. As the world’s most populous country, with one of the fastest growing economies, the outcome of the election will also have an impact internationally. India has become an increasingly important partner for countries including the UK, the US and France, which have all recently signed deals and pursued closer relationships with Delhi as a counterbalance to China. Modi’s BJP already commands a strong parliamentary majority after it swept the 2019 election, winning 303 seats, with votes for its coalition partners taking the total to 352. This time, the party is so confident of victory that it is aiming for the BJP-led alliance to win more than 400 seats in the 543-seat parliament. The BJP’s position is seen as unrivalled owing to Modi’s personal popularity and the concentration of power that has taken place under his watch, which includes highly organised party machinery and pioneering use of technology and social media as a way to reach voters. The BJP also boasts a vast, well-organised grassroots operation of activists and volunteers and has its own formidable propaganda machine, operating across social media and messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which in previous elections has been accused of disseminating disinformation on a grand scale. It is also considerably richer than any other party, and has far greater financial resources to spend on elections, spending an estimated almost 418bn rupees in the 2019 election. Nonetheless, while a BJP win is seen as highly probable, questions still remain about whether the party will be able to maintain the same overwhelming parliamentary majority it has enjoyed, with a few crucial states still up in the air and simmering discontentment over unemployment and inflation. A cult of personality has built up around the prime minister, who is seen as a strongman leader but also a man of the people. His humble background – growing up in a poor, low-caste family in Gujarat where he used to help his father sell tea – has helped project him as the opposite to the corrupt political elite. As a single man with no children, he often refers to the Indian people as “Modi ka Parivar” [Modi’s family]. Every month, millions tune into his radio show, Mann Ki Baat, where he talks to ordinary people about their issues and boasts about his government’s achievements. Modi’s face is also inescapable across the country, plastered across billboards, food rations that people receive, and even...",6 days ago,1

India votes in first phase of marathon election as Modi seeks third term,"Polls have closed in the first of seven phases that covered 102 constituencies across 21 states and territories. Millions of Indians have voted in the first phase of the world’s largest elections as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a third term on the back of issues such as growth, welfare and Hindu nationalism. The vote pits Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against an alliance of two dozen opposition parties that promise greater affirmative action and more handouts while stressing what they call the need to save democratic institutions. Before polls closed on Friday, the Election Commission said voter turnout ranged from 40 percent in the sprawling northern state of Bihar to 68 percent in the small northeastern state of Tripura. In the multiphase 2019 polls, the average turnout was 67 percent. “I urge all those voting … to exercise their franchise in record numbers,” Modi posted on the social media platform X before voting began. The main opposition Indian National Congress party urged voters to end “hatred and injustice” in a statement on X. About 969 million people have registered to vote in the six-week elections, including 18 million first-time voters and 197 million who are in their 20s. This makes India’s electorate bigger than the combined population of the 27 European Union member states. Friday’s vote was the first of seven phases, and it covered 102 constituencies across 21 states and territories from Tamil Nadu in the south to Arunachal Pradesh on the Himalayan frontier with China. Voters in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur also turned out in large numbers to vote in the shadow of ethnic clashes that have killed at least 220 people in the past year. Voters patiently assembled in a long and winding queue outside a polling station in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar in Uttarakhand state on the banks of the Ganges River before the booths opened. “I am here because I am happy about the direction the country is headed,” autorickshaw driver Ganga Singh, 27, told journalists. “I will vote, keeping in mind not personal welfare but the country’s prosperity.” Voting took place through electronic voting machines. Voters pressed the blue button corresponding to the serial number, name and symbol of the candidate of their choice or chose the option “none of the above”. While the voting process was generally peaceful, in Manipur, voting was soon disrupted over allegations of irregularities, Indian media reported. A paramilitary security officer in Bijapur district of the central state of Chhattisgarh was also injured in an “accidental” explosion, reports quoting the police said. Surveys suggested the BJP will easily win a majority in the Indian Parliament even though voters are worried about unemployment, inflation and rural distress. Jobs were the chief concern for Mohammed Shabbir, a Muslim voter in Kairana in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. None of his eight children has regular employment, the 60-year-old driver said. “Even the Hindus are affected by a lack of jobs,” he told the Reuters news agency, insisting that the problem outweighs the appeal of Hindu nationalism in the Hindu-majority nation. In Tamil Nadu, where the BJP is weak, voters seemed divided on whether Modi’s strong push this time around would benefit his party. “The BJP may not boost its vote share in Tamil Nadu, but nationwide, Modi will win hands down again,” S Rajagopal, a three-wheeled taxi driver in the state capital, Chennai, told Reuters. Attacks on minorities, mainly Muslims, since Modi’s rise to power and an alleged gag on free speech and media are also among the issues likely to affect the elections. Modi’s government has “controlled Muslims”, Ramesh Chand, a Hindu biscuit baker in Kairana near Muzaffarnagar, told local media. BJP spokesman Mohan Krishna expressed confidence that his party would sweep the elections. “The opposition is in disarray,” he told Al Jazeera. “The welfare schemes, … a corruptionless government,” led by Modi has given “immense satisfaction as well as confidence to the people.” Krishna also said allegations of backsliding of democracy under Modi were “absolutely rubbish”. “Democracy and the constitution are held high by the BJP, and we have proved that … in the last 10 years,” he said. But some BJP insiders and analysts said the party is worried about complacency or overconfidence among voters and party members and needs to draw more people to vote. The opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), to which the Congress party belongs, has criticised the BJP for rising unemployment and corruption while also challenging the...",6 days ago,1

The voters, who comprise over 10% of the world’s population, will elect 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a term of five years. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File) NEW DELHI (AP) — Nearly 970 million people — or over 10% of the global population — are eligible to vote in India’s general elections that start Friday and last to June 1. The mammoth exercise is the biggest anywhere in the world and will take 44 days before results are announced on June 4. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third successive term. He will face off against a broad but flailing alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to challenge his appeal. Most surveys predict Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party will win comfortably, cementing him as one of the country’s most popular and consequential leaders. Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 It boils down to two key reasons: the sheer size of India, the world’s most populous country, and the astonishing level of logistics needed to ensure that every registered voter is able to cast their ballot. Over the years, the duration of voting has wavered. It took nearly four months to complete the vote in India’s first elections in 1951-1952, after it gained independence from British rule, and just four days in 1980. In 2019, voting took 39 days, and this year’s election is the second longest. With 969 million registered voters, the size of India’s electorate is bigger than the combined population of the 27 European Union member states. This includes 18 million first-time voters, and around 197 million who are in their 20s. The vote to choose 543 lawmakers for the lower house of Parliament takes place over seven phases. India’s 28 states and eight federal territories will vote at different times. Each phase is one day, with the first held on April 19 and the last on June 1. While some states will cast their ballots in a day, voting elsewhere may take longer. The largest state, Uttar Pradesh, which is the size of Brazil with 200 million people, will vote on all seven days, for example. General elections in India tend to take weeks to conduct, but Modi’s opponents also say it gives him an advantage as it makes it easier for the prime minister, the public face of the BJP, to travel and campaign, especially in states where they are weak. The Election Commission of India, which oversees the vote, has to make sure there is a voting booth available within 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of every voter. “Election officials have to travel to great lengths to ensure that even a single voter can exercise their franchise,” said Chakshu Roy of PRS Legislative Research, an independent think tank.

The 2024 general elections will pan out in seven phases over the next six weeks, starting April 19. Voters will decide who fills the seats of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, for the next five years. The Lok Sabha is the more powerful of the two houses of Parliament. Whichever party or coalition that wins the majority will lead the government and pick the next prime minister. Analysts widely expect Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to score another landslide victory in the upcoming elections. Here's why India's elections matter. Under Modi's rule, India's economy has scaled to new heights. It is now the world's fifth-largest economy with a GDP of $3.7 trillion and has set its sight on becoming the world's third largest economy by 2027. Home to 1.4 billion people, India is the fastest growing economy in the world. Its economy grew 7.2% in fiscal 2022-2023, the second-highest among the G20 countries. The International Monetary Fund projects that India's economy will grow 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025, compared to China's predicted growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025. That's not all. India's stock market overtook Hong Kong's in December to become the fourth largest in the world, and is now valued at over $4 trillion. Analysts expect Modi to win a third consecutive five-year term, further driving India's growth trajectory. ""The growth story is not done. But private and foreign investments have been very subdued and exports have also declined,"" Suyash Rai, deputy director and fellow at Carnegie India told CNBC. ""So I feel that there is some weakness building up."" India has forged deeper ties with the West in the past year, and Modi's reelection could further strengthen U.S.-India relations, said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow...",1 week ago,1
How dubious YouTube ânewsâ channels are boosting Modi in Indiaâs election,"In YouTube’s largest market, self-proclaimed news channels are booming, gaining millions of viewers peddling falsehoods aimed at helping Prime Minister Modi’s campaign. Mumbai, India – On one channel, a male journalist chastises an Indian Muslim man sympathetic with Palestinians, asking him: “Did you stand with Hindus when they suffered atrocities in Pakistan and Afghanistan?” On another channel, a journalist gleefully asks a Muslim resident of the city of Ayodhya whether Muslims were happy that a Ram temple had come up on the site of a centuries-old mosque demolished by a Hindu nationalist mob. A female anchor on yet another channel alleges that a conspiracy is afoot to make India’s southern state of Kerala an ‘Islamic State’, with the hub of this conspiracy being Wayanad, the parliamentary constituency of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, quoting no evidence to substantiate her allegation. India, with over 460 million users, is YouTube’s largest market, with four out of five internet users in India consuming its content. Increasingly, more and more Indians are getting their news from YouTube. What is on offer, though, is not always news. Some of the most popular YouTube news channels in India are increasingly offering a smattering of disinformation and Islamophobia, often cheerleading Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while targeting its critics and opposition leaders. While partisan YouTube influencers making political content in favour of either side of the political divide is a common phenomenon, what makes these channels unique is that they claim to be ‘news’ channels, ostensibly presenting fact-based reportage. From mocking and attacking Modi’s rival politicians to peddling conspiracy theories about Muslims trying to harm Hindus, these channels often complement the BJP’s own campaign efforts. These channels, though lesser known than mainstream news channels, have millions of viewers, giving them an outsized role in how the world’s largest democracy is consuming news as India prepares for its national election. For instance, NMF News, which ranks among India’s top 100 YouTube news and politics channels, has over 18.2 million subscribers with over 8.1 billion views. Headlines India, with over 8.83 million subscribers has nearly 3 billion views; Rajdharma News, with its 3.2 million subscribers has nearly 0.9 billion views. With such a wide reach, concerns around how such ‘news’ outlets might shape perceptions and opinions – especially in election season – are rising. Studies have shown that Indians place greater trust in news they view on YouTube and WhatsApp, over news delivered by mainstream media outlets, even though many have warned of YouTube’s role in promoting disinformation. Already, the World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Risk Report has concluded that the most severe risk India faces is the fallout from the spread of false information. Most of these channels, surveyed for this piece, routinely stoked disinformation against Muslims, dissenters and critics of Modi and the BJP, in the guise of reporting ‘news’. NMF News denied allegations of such a bias but insisted that it was the “fastest-growing” channel, which was “sometimes right-wing” in its approach, but was always “fact-based”, according to Pankaj Prasoon, the bureau chief of NMF News in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand. Headlines India and Rajdharma News did not respond, despite repeated requests for comments over publicly listed emails. As election campaigning heats up in India, so too is the disinformation on these channels. On March 13, NMF News published a three-minute-long report on its channel on one of India’s premier-most universities, the public-funded Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi. JNU has been in the cross-hairs of the Modi government owing to its left-leaning student politics, with it often being dubbed as an ‘anti-national’ space by many Modi supporters. NMF’s news report, titled ‘No More Sloganeering in the Anti-National Hub of JNU’, rehashes and echoes this political rhetoric. It laments how the university had, over time, become “the hub of antinational activities”, attributing it to “the rapid spread of leftist thought”, before going on to plug an upcoming film titled JNU, which depicts the politics on campus and has a revealing tagline: “Can One Educational University Break the Nation?” Another story is titled Amit Shah’s Solid Action Leaves Rahul In Shivers, with a thumbnail image of close Modi aide and Home Minister Amit Shah, while Rahul Gandhi is shown with folded hands. Yet another video mocks Gandhi over his recent journey crisscrossing the country to meet supporters. NMF is not alone.

Modiâs elections or Dictator Aladeenâs Olympics?,"Many in India are making comparisons between the upcoming elections and the rigged Olympic Games depicted in the 2012 comedy Dictator. They are not wrong. There is a famous scene in Sasha Baron Cohen’s 2012 comedy “Dictator”. Dictator Aladeen participates in a 100-metre race that is part of the Olympic Games that he himself organised. He has the pistol that announces the start of the race. He fires it after he starts running. As he runs ahead of his competitors, he shoots anyone who comes close to him. One by one, all the runners fall down – either with a bullet wound or out of fear. When Dictator Aladeen becomes visibly out of breath, the people holding the ribbon that makes up the finish line start running towards him. He crosses that ribbon and wins the race. We are then told that he has won a total of 14 medals in the Olympic Games. This scene has become quite popular on Indian social media since it was announced that elections for the 18th Lok Sabha will be held between April 19 and June 1 across the country. People are commenting that what was parodied in that scene in the movie Dictator is actually happening in India today. And they have ample reason to reach that conclusion. Sure, India cannot formally be classified as a dictatorship, but it currently cannot be classified as a functioning, healthy democracy either. There are, in fact, some undeniable similarities between the actions of fictional Dictator Aladeen in the 2012 movie and those of India’s current rulers on the eve of the 2024 election. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, for example, launched its large-scale, state-funded election campaign long before the date for the election was announced and campaigning budgets for all parties were allocated. Thus, it had a head start over the opposition political parties. Furthermore, just before the announcement of the dates for the 2024 elections, the government amended the rules for selecting members of the Election Commission overseeing the vote. Earlier, the selection committee included the prime minister and the leader of the opposition as well as the chief justice of India. This was to ensure some impartiality in the selection. But this year, the government abruptly changed the rules. It removed the chief justice from the committee and replaced him with a government minister to be appointed by the PM. This means that now the government’s opinion will be paramount in the selection of the Election Commission. It is as if the captain of only one of the several teams participating in a game appoints the umpire. What is then left to say about the impartiality of the Election Commission? Just after the announcement of elections, on March 21, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the opposition Aam Aadmi Party, was arrested by India’s financial crime agency, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which alleged that he was the mastermind of a scam relating to Delhi’s new liquor excise policy. At the time of Kejriwal’s arrest, three more Aam Aadmi Party leaders, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Health Minister Satyendar Jain and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, were already in jail. The Supreme Court recently granted bail to Singh, but it is looking highly unlikely that the other opposition leaders will be freed in time to participate in the election. The Delhi High Court extended Kejriwal’s judicial custody until at least April 23 earlier today. These arrests are bound to have an impact on the opposition’s election campaign. And these are not the only opposition figures facing threats of incarceration and legal warfare in the run-up to the election. Many opposition party leaders across the country have received notices and arrest warrants relating to various current and historical cases in the past few months. On April 5, for example, an arrest warrant was issued against former Bihar Chief Minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav in a case related to the alleged illegal purchase of arms and ammunition in 1995-97. It is clear that investigating agencies of the government are trying to imprison, or merely entangle in legal troubles, leading opposition figures so that they are not able to devote full attention and energy to their election campaigns. The government appears also to be targeting opposition institutions to limit their ability to run an effective election campaign. Over the past month, India’s Income Tax Department served the main opposition Congress Party multiple tax notices worth hundreds of...",1 week ago,1

"Lok Sabha elections 2024: Why Congress is campaigning against its party 
candidate in Rajasthan's Banswara","After much flip-flop, the Congress decided to support Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) candidate Rajkumar Roat - a day before the last date of withdrawal of nominations - despite fielding its own candidate Arvind Damor read more As the second phase of the Lok Sabha election approaches in less than 24 hours, a unique electoral scenario unfolds in Rajasthan’s tribal-dominated Banswara-Dungarpur Lok Sabha constituency. The Congress is urging voters not to support its candidate. In fact, the party is supporting a Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) candidate. Here’s why. ‘Don’t vote for Damor’ Behind this peculiar poll battle, where the Congress is appealing to the people not to vote for its candidate, are internal conflicts and a lack of cooperation between Congress’ state and central units. After many flip-flops, the Congress decided to support Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) candidate Rajkumar Roat — a day before the last date of withdrawal of nominations — despite fielding its own candidate, Arvind Damor. Following the party’s announcement to support the BAP, Damor was supposed to withdraw his nomination papers but he was nowhere to be seen till the last date of withdrawal of nominations was over. Later, appearing before the media, Damor feigned ignorance about the developments and declared that he would contest the election. What was supposed to be a bipolar contest between the BJP and the Congress-BAP alliance has turned into a three-way fight with Damor likely to divide the Congress votes thus, giving an edge to the saffron party candidate — Mahendrajit Singh Malviya. While the local leadership of the Congress has appealed to the people to vote for Roat instead of their own candidate, Damor has claimed that he has the support of a section of the party leaders who are against the alliance with the BAP. Vikas Bamnia, a district-level leader, and the son of Congress MLA Arjun Bamnia said the party was supporting Roat. “Our stand is clear, we are supporting the BAP candidate. We are working keeping in mind the sentiments of the people and the directions received from the party,” Bamnia said. Another local Congress leader said, “We are asking people clearly to not vote for the Congress candidate (Damor).” Although several local residents told Press Trust of India that the contest was primarily between Malviya and Roat, some were of the view that Damor’s refusal to toe the party line was embarrassing for the Congress. BAP, which was established in southern Rajasthan ahead of the 2023 Assembly elections, has three MLAs, including Roat. The battle for Banswara Banswara-Dungarpur is a reserved seat for Scheduled Tribes and will go to polls in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections on Friday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally in Banswara on Sunday. Slamming the Congress manifesto, he had alleged that the Opposition party was planning to give people’s hard-earned money to “infiltrators” and “those who have more children” and referred to former PM Manmohan Singh’s speech in 2006 to contend he had said that Muslims have the “first claim” on the country’s resources. Also read: How much does it cost to conduct the poll? In his campaigning speeches, Malviya has accused Roat of misleading the people of Banswara while he, in return, has been charged with dividing the tribal community by the Congress-BAP candidate. “Where will these people take our tribal brothers and sisters? They are misleading the tribal community. Building a house for one person does not benefit the entire community,” Malviya, who joined the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, said. “These people are working to spread anarchy. No matter how much they try, the BJP is going to win this seat by lakhs of votes. The alliance of Congress and BAP will not work. It only shows that the Congress did not get a candidate for the Banswara-Dungarpur seat,” he added. Countering him, Raot said the BJP candidate was “dividing” and abusing the tribal community. “The kind of statements Malviya is giving… he is abusing the tribal community. The BJP is trying to divide the tribal community. Our tribal people may be associated with any party, be it the BJP or the Congress, but it is our responsibility to unite them. We think above the party, we think for the tribal people,” he said. Damor, meanwhile, said a faction of the Congress leaders was against the alliance with BAP. “I have support from the people and the party leaders who are not in favour of the alliance. I am confident of winning the...",1 day ago,1
"Banswara Lok Sabha Election: Congress Urges Voters Not To Vote For Its 
Candidate In Tribal-Dominated Rajasthan Seat","The election between the BJP and the Congress-BAP alliance, which was predicted to be a bipolar contest, has instead become a three-way race. Damor is expected to split the Congress votes, which will benefit Mahendrajit Singh Malviya, the candidate of the saffron party. In Rajasthan's tribal-majority Banswara-Dungarpur Lok Sabha constituency, an odd election contest is expected as the Congress is pleading with voters not vote for its candidate. The reason being despite fielding its candidate, Arvind Damor, the Congress ultimately chose to support Rajkumar Roat of the Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP)- a day before the deadline for nomination withdrawals. Damor was supposed to withdraw his nomination papers in accordance with the party's announcement that it would support the BAP, but he did not show up until the deadline for nomination withdrawals had passed. Later, when Damor appeared before the press, he claimed not to be aware of the events and announced that he would contest the election.

Although the Congress leadership in the area has urged voters to support Roat over their own candidate, Damor has asserted that he has the backing of some party leaders who are opposed to the alliance with the BAP. The party is backing Roat, according to district-level leader Vikas Bamnia, who is the son of Congress MLA Arjun Bamnia. ""Our stand is clear, we are supporting the BAP candidate. We are working keeping in mind the sentiments of the people and the directions received from the party,"" Mr Bamnia said.

"Lok Sabha Election 2024 Phase 1 Voting: Voting In 21 States Today As 
India's National Election Begins: 10 Points","Indian General Election 2024 Phase 1: In 2019, the UPA won 45 of these 102 seats (Representational)
The first phase of polls is being held on all seats of Tamil Nadu (39), Rajasthan (12), Uttar Pradesh (8), Madhya Pradesh (6), Uttarakhand (5), Arunachal Pradesh (2), Meghalaya (2), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1), Mizoram (1), Nagaland (1), Puducherry (1), Sikkim (1) and Lakshadweep (1). Besides, there will be five seats each in Assam and Maharashtra, four in Bihar, three in West Bengal, two in Manipur, and one each in Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, and Chhattisgarh.
Four states -- Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh -- will also pick new assemblies alongside this Lok Sabha election. Of these, Arunachal Pradesh (60 seats) and Sikkim (32) are first down.
At 7 pm, the recorded voting turnout was 60.03 per cent. Tamil Nadu had recorded 63.2 per cent turnout, Rajasthan 50.3 per cent, Uttar Pradesh 57.5 per cent and Madhya Pradesh 63.3 per cent. As for the state polls taking place alongside the general election, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh recorded 67.5 and 64.7 per cent turnout, respectively.   
In Bengal, Trinamool Congress and BJP workers clashed in Cooch Behar and accused each other of violence, intimidating voters and assault on poll agents, news agency PTI reported. The police denied any violence took place. In Manipur, a burst of gunfire was reported from a polling station in Bishnupur. In Imphal East district, a polling station was vandalised. In Tamil Nadu, two elderly people -- one a 77-year-old woman -- died at polling booths in Salem district.
Backed by a high-octane campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the BJP is aiming to win 370 of 543 Lok Sabha seats - a steep rise from its score of 2019. The Prime Minister has set the NDA a target of 400. In the last election, the NDA won 353 seats -- up by 5 per cent from 2014. The BJP won 303 seats.
The Opposition bloc INDIA, which mostly made headlines over its disarray in the run-up to the polls -- especially with the defection of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar -- has been standing together following the arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the liquor policy case. Even so, in multiple pockets, the parties are up against each other, flouting the rule of one-on-one contests they guaranteed would push the BJP out.
The BJP is hoping to win 22 of the 25 seats in the northeast - an area it now dominates -- sweep the huge swathe of the Hindi heartland, Jammu in the north and Gujarat in the west. In Bengal, it is hoping to flourish at the cost of Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and make further inroads in Odisha, even though the proposed alliance with Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal fell through.
In south -- once a fortress against all northern parties except the Congress -- the BJP is expecting to win big in Karnataka, which voted in a Congress government last year. With outreaches spearheaded by PM Modi, it is also hoping to make a dent in the Dravidian politics of Tamil Nadu. As insurance, it is piggybacking on a handful of smaller parties, including PMK of S Ramadoss.
The Congress, pushed out of much of north India, insists it is on the cusp of a comeback. Senior leader KC Venugopal has said the party will post improved performance in most northern states - including the BJP bastions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. With assembly poll victories in Telangana and Karnataka, and the alliance with DMK in Tamil Nadu, it projects huge confidence about the results in the south.
Eight Union ministers, two former chief ministers, one former governor and a number of key leaders are in the fray today, making for scintillating contests in more than 20 seats. Among them are Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Jitendra Singh, Kiren Rijiju, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Sanjiv Balyan, former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, Congress's Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi and former Chief Minister of Assam Sarbananda Sonowal. The counting of votes will take place on June 4.

"India's 2024 election kicks off, with major implications for the world's 
biggest democracy","Watch CBS News By Arshad R. Zargar Updated on: April 19, 2024 / 4:01 AM EDT / CBS News New Delhi — People started casting votes Friday in India in what's set to be the largest general election ever held anywhere in the world, with nearly 1 billion eligible voters. The election will be held in seven phases, starting Friday and lasting until June 1. Election officials are expected to announce the results on June 4. Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi is vying for a third term in office. Pre-election polling is illegal in India, but a survey found Modi's overall approval rating had risen to 75% in February, a figure that jumped 15% in the last two years. His supporters would argue his popularity surged because of his work in bringing India up on the world stage as a major power, and his critics would say it's because of his shrewd pro-Hindu and anti-Muslim policies. But his party's victory is not guaranteed, and there's a lot on the line — not only for the world's most populous nation, but for the wider tenets of democracy in what has been for decades a lauded example of political freedom in Asia. India is home to more than 1.4 billion people. It has 969 million eligible voters this year, compared to 912 million when the last national election was held in 2019. By comparison, as the U.S. heads toward its own national election in November, fewer than 170 million people are likely to be eligible to cast ballots. It has taken India's Election Commission months of preparation and the mobilization of some 15 million election officers and security staff to pull off the mammoth exercise in democracy. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are, in some cases, even carried on horseback or by elephant to reach remote communities, taking as long as almost seven weeks to reach the country's far-flung corners where infrastructure can be lacking. The commission has set up more than 1 million polling stations across India, with the objective being for every voter to have one within 1.24 miles of their home. One booth was being set up high in the Himalayan mountains and, at an altitude of 15,256 feet, it was billed as the world's highest polling station. The election body said it would use 5.5 million EVMs. The machines were first introduced for India's 1982 national election. Some opposition parties have raised concerns over the EVMs being prone to hacking and tampering, but the commission and the government have maintained that they are reliable. Voters will elect Members of Parliament to fill 543 seats in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha. The other two seats are nominated by the country's president. The party that wins a majority in the election will form the next government and appoint one of its winning candidates as India's prime minister. The contest involves six national parties, 57 state parties and more than 2,500 smaller local parties. Not all political parties field candidates nationally. Combined, fewer than 12 parties hold 86% of the seats in the Lok Sabha. One of the main political parties is Modi's Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), which has seen its popularity rise steadily since he won his first term in 2014. The BJP's biggest rival is the Indian National Congress (INC), the country's oldest political party and one that has been in power for more than 50 of the 77 years of India's existence as an independent nation. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose father, grandmother and great-grandfather all served as prime ministers, is Modi's fiercest opponent and the face of the country's political opposition. Last month, the INC party accused Modi's government of misusing the tax federal agency to stifle democracy, announcing that it had frozen the party's bank accounts in a tax dispute case. Former Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, the current party leader's mother, said it was ""a systematic effort to cripple the party financially."" ""We have no money to campaign. We cannot support our candidates. Our ability to fight elections has been damaged,"" Rahul Gandhi said. The Congress Party also accused ""autocratic"" Modi's government of ""capturing democracy through extortion and financial terrorism."" Modi's BJP government has denied the allegations. Concerns have also been raised over the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of the sprawling Delhi capital region and head of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), on March 21. He was taken into custody by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), India's federal...",1 week ago,1
India election 2024: Which are the main political parties in the fray?,"More about Modi’s BJP, Rahul Gandhi’s Congress and other parties that are central to the world’s largest democratic exercise. India will kick off the world’s largest democratic exercise on Friday, with 969 million registered voters casting the ballot to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of parliament over seven phases starting April 19. The world’s most populous country has more than 2,500 political parties, but a mere 10 of them currently hold 86 percent of the seats in the Lok Sabha. Here is a look at the main parties vying for the Lok Sabha seats this year: Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP claims to be the world’s largest political organisation, with almost 180 million members. The BJP was born in 1980 out of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh party, an offshoot of the far-right Hindu nationalist organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS, formed in 1925 along the lines of European ethnonationalism movements and fascist parties, wants India to be defined as a Hindu nation. Today, the secretive men-only organisation is the ideological fountainhead of dozens of Hindu right-wing groups, including the BJP, and counts Modi and many top BJP leaders as its lifetime members. The BJP was founded shortly after the controversial imposition of a state of emergency by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of the Congress in 1975. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a prominent Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader, opposed the emergency – a plank that brought a coalition of anti-Congress parties to power in 1977. But the alliance collapsed in two years due to political infighting and Vajpayee formed the BJP in 1980 with his close aide, Lal Krishna Advani. In 1996, Vajpayee became the first BJP prime minister but his government only lasted 13 days. He returned to power for 13 months in 1998-1999 and then from 1999 to 2004 – the first non-Congress prime minister to serve a complete term. Modi, 73, born and raised in the western state of Gujarat, has been an RSS member since his 20s. He was also in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh before it became the BJP. Modi rose through the ranks over the years and was the chief minister of Gujarat for more than a decade. In 2014, Modi led the BJP to form its first-ever majority government on its own and he has been in power since. He is seeking a third term through re-election from Varanasi, a city in the northern Uttar Pradesh state, which holds religious significance for the Hindu majority. Congress is India’s oldest political party, dating back to 1885 when the British ruled over the Indian subcontinent. The “grand old party” has governed India for more than two-thirds of the years since its independence in 1947, with its Western-educated Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru credited with laying its liberal and secular foundations. Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi was India’s first and only female prime minister. The Congress also introduced landmark economic reforms in 1991, making the way for the evolution of an open market economy. But the Congress has struggled after Modi swept to power in 2014. Rahul Gandhi, Modi’s fiercest opponent and Congress’s star campaigner, quit as the party chief after a miserable performance in the last parliamentary polls in 2019. Yet, the 53-year-old four-time parliament member remains at the centre of India’s opposition politics and Modi’s main target. A scion of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty, his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira and great-grandfather Nehru were all prime ministers and led the country for more than 37 years. Gandhi is the main face of the Congress-led 26-member opposition alliance, named the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). He organised two cross-country marches to invigorate his election campaign and tap into discontent over rural distress, unemployment and income inequality. Gandhi is contesting this year’s election from Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala. The Aam Aadmi Party ,or Common Person’s Party, rose from a potent anticorruption movement in 2011 amid protests led by Anna Hazare – a self-styled crusader backed by close aide Arvind Kejriwal. For this election, the AAP is part of the INDIA alliance. Kejriwal, a staunch Modi critic, founded the AAP in 2012 and formed a state government in the national capital region of Delhi in 2015, staging an unexpected political upset for established parties like the BJP and Congress. Kejriwal has been the chief minister of Delhi since. The party also runs Punjab state. However, AAP’s prospects this year are clouded by pre-election arrests of several of its high-profile...",1 week ago,1

YouTube Approves Ads With Disinformation on Indian Election,"YouTube approved dozens of ads promoting voter suppression and incitement to violence ahead of the upcoming election in India, according to a new investigation by the rights groups Global Witness and Access Now, shared exclusively with TIME. India, a country often described as the world’s largest democracy, will hold its election in seven phases between April 19 and June 1 of this year. Voters are set to decide whether to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rule the country for a third term, or to deal his Hindu nationalist political project an unlikely defeat. In a calendar year where more than half the world’s population will vote in at least 65 different national elections, India’s is by far the biggest. It will also be a crucial test—ahead of the U.S. election in November—of social media platforms’ ability to tackle election disinformation, following a spate of job cuts across the industry. Read More: A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy Worldwide To test YouTube’s ability to prevent disinformation on its platform, Global Witness and Access Now submitted 48 advertisements containing election-related content prohibited by YouTube rules. The ads were written in three different languages widely spoken in India: Hindi, Telugu, and English. Within a 24-hour review period, YouTube approved 100% of the ads. Global Witness and Access Now then withdrew the ads before they were published, meaning no voters were exposed to their contents. The experiment indicates that Google-owned YouTube may be failing to prevent the spread of paid-for disinformation in one of the most significant global elections of the year. “Frankly, we weren’t expecting such a despicable result,” says Namrata Maheshwari, senior policy counsel at Access Now. “We thought they would do better at least catching the English ads, but they didn’t, which means the problem is not the language—it’s more also a problem of which countries they’re choosing to focus on.” The findings, she said, point to a “lack of regard for the global majority at large” inside YouTube. A Google spokesperson said the company applies its policies ""globally and consistently,"" and disputed the methodology of the report. “Not one of these ads ever ran on our systems and this report does not show a lack of protections against election misinformation in India,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. “Our enforcement process has multiple layers to ensure ads comply with our policies, and just because an ad passes an initial technical check does not mean it won’t be blocked or removed by our enforcement systems if it violates our policies. But the advertiser here deleted the ads in question before any of our routine enforcement reviews could take place.” The spokesperson added: “While an ad may initially be eligible to serve via our automated systems, this is just the first stage of our review and enforcement process. After this step, ads are still subject to several layers of reviews, to ensure the content complies with our policies. These protections can kick into place both before an ad runs or quickly after it starts to gain impressions.” YouTube has more than 450 million users in India, making it the most popular tech platform in the country after the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp. But, unlike WhatsApp, YouTube offers a sophisticated set of targeted advertising tools to businesses and political parties. On YouTube, advertisers can pay to target ads at users based on specific characteristics like age, gender, location, interests, and usage patterns. The system is highly lucrative: YouTube recorded $9.2 billion in ad revenue in the final three months of 2023 alone, according to Google’s most recent public financial statements. Some of the ads approved by YouTube contained false information aimed at suppressing votes, such as saying ID is not required to vote, or that women could vote by text message. (In fact, voting in India requires an identification document, and must be done at a polling station unless a voter is eligible for a postal ballot.) One ad falsely claimed that the voting age had been increased to 21, and that people under that age attempting to vote would be breaking the law. (The actual voting age in India is 18.) “Due to an increase in infectious diseases, all voters will be automatically sent a mail-in ballot for the 2024 elections,” one false ad said. “Stay home and stay safe.” (There are no such disease-related restrictions.)

Indiaâs opposition protest against Modiâs âmatch-fixingâ before election,"Parties unite at New Dehli rally to accuse PM of ‘tax terrorism’ and rigging the vote, after arrest of prominent leader
Indian opposition parties united on Sunday to protest against the arrest of a prominent leader weeks before a national election, accusing the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his party of rigging the vote and harassing them with large tax demands.
“Narendra Modi is trying match-fixing in this election,” the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, told a rally in New Delhi, as the crowd chanted “shame”.
Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal – a staunch critic of Modi, an anti-corruption crusader and a high-profile leader of the INDIA opposition alliance – was arrested on 21 March for alleged graft over granting liquor licences, less than a month before voting starts in a general election widely expected to solidify Modi’s mandate with a rare third term.
Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi party says the case against him is fabricated and politically motivated. Modi’s government and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) deny political interference and say law enforcement agencies are doing their job.
Gandhi said: “If the BJP wins this match-fixing election and changes the constitution, it will light the country on fire. This is not an ordinary election. This election is to save the country, protect our constitution.“
Gandhi’s Congress party ruled India for more than two-thirds of the time since the country gained independence from Britain in 1947, but has struggled since Modi swept to power a decade ago.
Sharing the stage with Gandhi during the rally at the popular Ramlila Maidan gathering site in New Delhi were opposition leaders including regional party heads who have overcome their differences regarding which party would contest which seats.
Sunita Kejriwal, the wife of Kejriwal, told the rally: “This fascism will not work in India. We will fight and we will win.”
Modi said his fight against corruption had rattled the opposition. He said this election was a fight between his party and its allies, who want to remove the corrupt, and an opposition that wants to protect the corrupt.
“Big corrupt people are behind bars and even the supreme court is not giving them bail,” Modi said in a rally to launch his election campaign in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.
Congress – besides struggling with detentions and raids by India’s financial crime-fighting agency – says it is battling “tax terrorism” amid large tax demands by the government and the freezing of some of its bank accounts, which it says are attempts to financially cripple the party.
Critics say Modi and his party have weaponised investigative agencies and tax authorities to cull political opponents and reduce the chances of a fair election, an accusation the BJP denies.",4 weeks ago,1

"Can Indiaâs election be rigged? Ahead of vote, old debate gets new life","Opposition parties have questioned the reliability of electronic voting machines. But transparency experts say any manipulation happens before the vote. New Delhi, India – As he launched the main Indian opposition alliance’s election campaign in the middle of March, Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at two targets: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he described as the “king”, and the electronic voting machines (EVMs) that the country uses to cast ballots. “The soul of the king is in the EVM,” Gandhi said in Mumbai. The allegation: that the machines can be hacked, and that Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) owes its electoral dominance over India to that malpractice, even though multiple opinion polls suggest the prime minister’s party is resoundingly the favourite among voters in many parts of the country. The charge isn’t new. The Congress and some other opposition parties have previously too questioned the trustworthiness of EVMs, machines that are not connected to the internet yet run on chips that critics say could, in theory, be programmed to record votes in a way that doesn’t match the buttons that voters press. The Election Commission of India (ECI), which conducts the country’s votes, and even the Supreme Court, have rubbished these allegations and no conclusive evidence has emerged yet to substantiate the claims. But as India now heads for national elections over seven drawn-out phases starting April 19, Gandhi has made the possibility of election fraud a central talking point. The Congress leader, who has been on a long march, is demanding that India return to the paper ballots it used in elections until the late 1990s, which were counted manually. That demand was rejected last week by the Supreme Court. The Election Commission called it a “regressive” proposal. Yet, the chorus of demands from the Congress and its supporters isn’t going away – even though opposition parties lead governments in almost half of the country’s states, formed through elections also conducted using EVMs. Elections that they won. Congress leader Digvijay Singh – the former chief minister of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh – is a consistent campaigner against the machines. He leads a loosely built group of critics from the country’s opposition parties and nonprofits demanding a return to paper ballots. Ritu Singh, a young Dalit academic, has been going viral on YouTube, X and Instagram with her comments, speeches and videos, in which she alleges that Indian democracy has been imperilled by EVMs. In New Delhi, traditional Congress voter Gregory Ekka said he no longer trusts the elections. “We all vote for the Congress, but we do not know where our vote goes. Till there is EVM, BJP would continue to be in power,” said Ekka, whose tribe from the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand has historically voted for the Congress. To build confidence in the EVMs, the Election Commission in 2013 introduced the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail, or VVPAT, which is a slip of paper that is visible to the voter for seven seconds before it slides into a box kept alongside the voting machine. On the paper, a voter can check whether their ballot has been recorded correctly. In 2017, the Election Commission decided that votes on VVPAT slips would be counted, in a handful of polling stations in every constituency, to randomly test whether the tallies matched with those shown by EVMs. The Congress and some other opposition parties are now demanding that VVPAT slips be counted for all polling stations across the country. But veteran election officers and independent analysts say the opposition is mistaken in questioning the credibility of EVMs. Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi said he is convinced that any election rigging cannot be “through EVM”. He said he supports counting VVPAT slips to rebuild trust in the Election Commission as an independent body that holds elections. “Even if it takes more days to count these VVPAT slips to match the EVM count, it should be done,” he said. But any electoral malpractice that might happen occurs before the actual voting, he said. “Elections can be won or lost before elections,” Quraishi said. Before every election, the Election Commission puts out advertisements asking voters to check their names in the voter list – to make sure they haven’t been accidentally removed. “If they do not check how can ECI be blamed,” Quraishi said. Yet maintaining and updating electoral rolls accurately – and fairly – is no easy task. Weeding out names that are either duplicated or...",1 month ago,1
"At JNU, student âflame flickersâ against Indiaâs Modi before election","Will the polls at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University after a four-year hiatus also impact the general election starting next month? New Delhi, India – A Bollywood film called JNU will be released across India next week. The tagline on its publicity posters asks: “Can one educational university break the nation?” The film is only the latest, thinly veiled attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), one of India’s premier public universities that for decades has also been a cauldron of political activism, with admission criteria designed to ensure that students from some of the country’s poorest and most neglected regions get a shot at quality higher education. The university, a traditional bastion of left-liberal politics that is named after independent India’s first prime minister, has been a central target of political attacks from the country’s Hindu majoritarian right, especially under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rule. Like in the film, the university’s critics affiliated with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have described JNU as an “anti-national” hub over its politics. Students and ex-students have been jailed for treason. Teachers have accused the university administration, appointed by the BJP government, of weakening quality standards and processes for appointments to stock the faculty with ideologically aligned professors. Amid a heated campaign for national elections scheduled for April and May, the university held its own vote last week for the JNU Students Union (JNUSU), which has historically been one of India’s most powerful and influential student bodies. These were the first JNUSU polls in four years, and results came out on Sunday. Nationally, the BJP is predicted to win. At JNU, it lost. “This election was a referendum against the right wing,” Dhananjay, the new students union president, said in his victory speech. The 28-year-old student of theatre and performance studies at JNU’s School of Arts and Aesthetics is also the first Dalit to be elected JNUSU president in nearly three decades. Located on rocky, forested slopes in southern New Delhi, JNU is often described as a bubble, and there is little evidence that the outcome of its student body elections is any reflection of the national mood. But for many in the institution best known for its pedagogy and research in the social sciences, the win on Sunday of a coalition of left-wing organisations, offered a breather from perceived efforts by the BJP and its allies to take over their oasis. The JNUSU has been dominated by groups affiliated with India’s many communist parties for decades. However, the rise of Hindu nationalism in the early 1990s saw the emergence of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a pan-India student organisation affiliated with the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the BJP. The university’s alumni include Nobel Laureates like Abhijit Banerjee, who won the economics prize in 2019, and foreign leaders such as former Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan and former Nepal Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. Many of India’s top political leaders — from Sitaram Yechury, the leader of India’s biggest communist party, to the current BJP government’s foreign minister S Jaishankar and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman — studied at JNU. On Sunday, thousands of JNU students gathered outside their union office to learn the results of the elections held last week, in which the ABVP was a strong challenger. But three of the top four posts were won by Left candidates while the remaining chair went to a queer woman from the Dalit community, which sits at the bottom of India’s complex caste hierarchy. Yet the national elections coming up could shape the future of JNU as much, if not more, than the students elected over the weekend. Since Modi became the prime minister in 2014, his government has portrayed the university as a hub of activities designed to break India. Students and ex-students – especially Muslims, such as Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam – have been arrested and charged with sedition and “terrorism”. Many remain behind bars. Students alleged that the university administration’s failure to hold elections since 2019 was also part of a pattern of actions aimed at stifling campus political activism. While COVID-19 lockdowns prevented the polls in 2020 and 2021, the subsequent years saw a reluctance by the JNU administration “because it wanted elections to stop forever”, outgoing JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh told Al Jazeera. “Conducting the election again seemed impossible, but the students showed solidarity and hope,” she said. Unlike other public universities, the elections at JNU are conducted by students who form an Election...",1 month ago,1
Just how big is Indiaâs 2024 election? Find out in seven numbers,"About 969 million people will take part in the giant elections to decide who will rule the world’s most populous nation. Al Jazeera breaks it down in seven numbers. New Delhi, India – India, the world’s largest democracy, has kicked off its two and a half month long parliamentary election to decide who will rule the South Asian nation. On Saturday, the Election Commission of India – the country’s independent poll-conducting body – announced the dates for a democratic exercise that is unmatched in scale globally, and in history. From the Himalayas in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south, from the hills of the east to the deserts in the west, and in concrete jungles that are some of the world’s biggest cities to the smallest of villages, an estimated 969 million voters are eligible to cast their ballots. They will elect 543 politicians to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament. Two other members are nominated, to make up a total strength of 545 in the house. India’s election is colossal, colourful and complex. Here are seven ways in which it is unparalleled in size. The election process that started on Saturday will continue for 82 days until results are announced on June 4. With the announcement of the schedule, a model code of conduct also kicks in – campaign rules now apply, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not supposed to announce new policies that could influence voters. Voting will run in seven phases from April 19 to June 1, said Rajiv Kumar, chief election commissioner of India. The counting of votes will take place on June 4. Assembly elections for the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim will also take place along with the national elections. After April 19, the other voting dates are April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1. Some states will complete voting on a single day, while others will have voting spread out across several phases. Over the years, the number of days over which voting has stretched has varied a lot – from the shortest ever four days in 1980 to 39 days in the 2019 election, to 44 days in 2024. The primary reason for the multiphased election is for the deployment of huge federal security forces required to check everything from polling-related violence or attempts at rigging, according to N Gopalaswami, the former chief election commissioner of India. Still, staggered polls are no guarantee for free and fair elections as longer campaigning favours the ruling party of the day, said N Bhaskara Rao, chairman of the New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies, and a pioneer in election research in India. Rao argued that the process should be shortened. The longer the process, the more the opportunity for the ruling party to use government infrastructure to campaign. The size of India’s electorate is more than the population of all the countries of Europe combined. They will cast their votes through 5.5 million electronic voting machines at 1.05 million polling stations, of which some are located in the snow-clad mountains in the Himalayas, the deserts of Rajasthan and sparsely populated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Election Commission will deploy about 15 million polling staff and security personnel to conduct the elections. They will trek across glaciers and deserts, ride elephants and camels, and travel by boats and helicopters to ensure every voter can cast their ballot. It is expected to be the world’s most expensive election. Spending by political parties and candidates to woo voters will likely cost more than 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.4bn), said Rao, whose organisation regularly estimates the country’s poll expenditure. That would be twice what was spent in India’s 2019 elections – 600 billion rupees ($7.2bn). The total spending on the US presidential and congressional races in 2020 was also $14.4bn. Most of India’s election spending is not publicly disclosed. Candidates spend unaccounted money to woo voters. The election scrutiny machinery is weak in detecting cash transactions, said Gopalaswami, referring to attempts by candidates to directly bribe voters with money or other enticements, from alcohol to clothes. Holding elections in the world’s seventh largest nation by area is a complex task. In 2019, election workers travelled 300 miles (482 km) over four days across winding mountain roads and river valleys to set up a polling booth for one voter in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China.

India elections 2024: Vote to be held in seven stages,,1 month ago,1
Date set for largest democratic election in human history,"Follow:

            Polls in the world’s largest democracy India will open on April 19, the country’s election commissioner announced on Saturday, setting the stage for a nationwide election expected to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi clinch a rare third consecutive term.
    

            An estimated 960 million people in a country of 1.4 billion are eligible to vote in the widely anticipated polls that will take a month to complete.
    

            Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to secure another five years in power, ruling an India that has become increasingly polarized along religious lines.
    

            Polling will unfold over seven phases around the country ending on June 1.
    

            Indians will be voting for 543 seats in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, and the other two seats in the house are nominated by the president.
    

            All the votes – from the country’s 28 states and eight union territories – will be counted on June 4, the commission said at a press conference in New Delhi.
    

            Under Modi’s leadership, India is poised to become a 21st-century powerhouse as its economy rapidly expands.
    

            But the populist leader, analysts say, has tightened his grip on its democratic institutions in a way not seen since the 1970s under the iron-fisted rule of Indira Gandhi, with minorities feeling persecuted under the BJP’s Hindu-nationalist policies and dissent muzzled.
    

            Going against Modi is the main opposition Indian National Congress, which has governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence and last year formed an alliance with other parties. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, marked a significant step for an opposition struggling to regain national significance.
    

            But cracks in the alliance have already emerged, and it has yet to put forward its candidate for prime minister, lacking anyone with the kind of star quality and appeal projected by Modi.
    

            The prime minister’s calendar last year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, where he presented himself as a statesman cementing the country as a modern global power.
    

            In August, India made history by soft-landing a rover on the moon, becoming just the fourth nation to do so. Weeks later, it launched its first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun.
    

            India hosted the Group of 20 (G20) in September, presenting New Delhi with an opportunity to extend its leadership beyond the country’s borders at a time of increasing political turmoil.
    

            This January, Modi marked the unofficial start of his election campaign when he inaugurated the controversial Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a Hindu temple in the holy city of Ayodhya that was built on the site of the destroyed Babri mosque.
    

            The consecration of that temple, analysts said, marked the seismic shift from India’s secular founding values as Modi disregards the norms dividing religion from state in his push to win a third term. But it was received well in many quarters, with Modi’s followers praising the leader for his dedication to the majority Hindu faith.
    

            In 2019, Modi’s BJP won 303 seats in parliament, taking it over the threshold of 272 required for an absolute majority, dealing a humiliating blow to the Congress party.
    

            Last year, India surpassed China as the world’s most populous country.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India on Saturday announced its 6-week-long general elections will start on April 19, with most surveys predicting a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. 
Voting in the world’s largest democracy will stretch over seven phases, with different states voting at different times and results will be announced on June 4. Over 970 million voters — more than 10% of the world’s population — will elect 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a term of five years. 
Modi, who is seeking a third consecutive term, faces little challenge as the main opposition alliance of over two dozen regional parties led by the Indian National Congress party appears to be cracking, riven by rivalries, political defections and ideological clashes. 
Analysts say the elections are likely to cement Modi as one of India’s most enduring most consequential leaders who has sought to transform the country from a secular democracy into an avowedly Hindu nation.
Each election phase will last one day and several constituencies — spread across multiple states, densely populated cities and far-flung villages — will vote that day. The staggered polling allows the government to deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence and transport electoral officials and voting machines.
India has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins.


Ahead of the polls, Modi has been travelling across the country inaugurating new projects, making speeches and engaging with voters. Support for the leader surged after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which many saw as the unofficial start of his election campaign because it fulfilled his party’s long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.
The 73-year-old Modi first swept to power in 2014 on promises of economic development, presenting himself as an outsider cracking down on the political elite. Since then, he has grown increasingly popular and mixed religion with politics in a formula that has resonated deeply with the country’s majority Hindu population even if it undermines India’s secular roots.
The elections come as India’s clout on the global stage has risen under Modi, thanks to its large economy and partly because it is seen as a counterweight to a rising China. 
Critics say that nearly a decade of Modi’s rule has been marked by rising unemployment even as its economy swells, attacks by Hindu nationalists against the country’s minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media. The opposition says a win by Modi’s party could threaten India’s status as a secular, democratic nation.
A victory for Modi’s BJP would follow a 2019 electoral triumph, when it secured an absolute majority with 303 parliamentary seats against 52 held by the Congress party.

"India to hold seven-phase general election from April 19, results on June 4","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term in the marathon six-week vote – the world’s largest democratic exercise.
India will hold a seven-phase general election starting on April 19, with the results to be declared on June 4.
The Election Commission of India announced the schedule of the six-week marathon vote during a news conference in New Delhi on Saturday.
Nearly 970 million voters – more than the entire population of the United States, the European Union and Russia combined – are eligible to cast their ballot, according to the poll panel’s data, making the election the largest democratic exercise in the world.
“We will take democracy to every corner of the country,” Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar said as he announced the voting dates. “It is our promise to deliver a national election in a manner that we … remain a beacon for democracy around the world.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a third straight term in the vote, has set a target of 370 seats for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 400-plus for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) the BJP heads in the 543-member lower house of parliament.
In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats – the most ever for the Hindu nationalist party that was formed in 1980.
 

 
Modi will be challenged by an alliance of two dozen opposition parties, called INDIA or the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, led by the Indian National Congress.
The alliance formed last year has, however, been struggling to stay united and share seats amicably to be able to put up a one-to-one fight against the BJP.
A victory would make Modi, 73, only the second prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s independence hero and its first prime minister, to win a third straight term.
Modi and his BJP have been in campaign mode for months before the dates for the vote were announced.
The prime minister has been flying around the country almost every day, inaugurating new projects, making announcements, taking part in religious events and addressing public and private meetings.
The first phase of the parliamentary election will be held on April 19, second on April 26, third on May 7, the fourth phase on May 13, the fifth on May 20, the sixth on May 25 and the seventh phase on June 1.
In four states – Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim – the parliamentary and legislative assembly elections will be held simultaneously, with their results to be also declared on June 4.
Bypolls for 26 assembly constituencies across the country will be also be held during the six-week vote.
There will be more than a million polling stations in operation staffed by 15 million poll workers, according to the election commission.

India Election 2024: What you need to know about Rahul Gandhi,,1 week ago,1
"Lok Sabha Elections since Independence (1952-2024): Relive all the previous 
17 Lok Sabha elections and how India ...","Published: April 17, 2024 Updated: April 18, 2024 Come June 2024, voters will elect to power India's 18th Lok Sabha. The nation's “mammoth” electoral exercise — the largest election in human history — will give way to a verdict that has historically reflected people's desires and despairs. As the election season sets in, we look back, tracing independent India's political history through the lens of The Hindu's archives. As with a time capsule, this interactive article takes you through the spectacular and stormy ongoings of each Lok Sabha since 1952: the people, the politics and the policies that defined India through the years. The social and cultural undercurrents also reveal themselves; the people's mandate always revealed the pulse that thrummed through the nation, steady or otherwise. This is the story of how India voted, from 1952 to 2019, and a glimpse into how The Hindu reported and documented these historical events in the pages of the newspaper. Read Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's speeches. Watch how India conducted its elections in the 1950s. Revisit the uncertainty of 2020, when Narendra Modi declared a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. Take a quiz about Indian leaders. And solve a jigsaw puzzle in the end. Read, listen, watch, play - engage with an independent India's political history through The Hindu's lens. Before you dive into India’s past, here’s a glance at its future. Piece together this puzzle of politicians starring in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The partition, Congress's role in the freedom struggle, Jawaharlal Nehru's appeal and a growing need for stability — democratic and economic — informed the anatomy and ambition of the first Lok Sabha. The ruling Congress consolidated its position in a post-independent India, benefiting from the absence of a strong Opposition and Jawaharlal Nehru's popularity and socialist vision. Congress formed the government for the third time but was beset with early signs of internal dissent. Regional parties gained national popularity, India went to war with China and Pakistan, and the non-alignment stance guided India's foreign policy. India's first, and only, female Prime Minister Indira Gandhi comes to power, enacting policies to curb economic distress. Internal conflict threatens Congress's stability, giving way to the emergence of coalition governments. Indira Gandhi's 'Garibi Hatao' slogan and role in Bangladesh war strengthened her appeal among the masses, but concern grew over her authoritarian streak within the party. India saw one of the darkest periods of post-independent history with the declaration of Emergency and the suspension of civil liberties. In the aftermath of the Emergency, disillusioned voters ejected the Congress from power and elected the Janata Party, led by Morarji Desai. Internal conflict destabilised the new government too. Indira Gandhi returns to power after the Janata Party experiment failed at the Centre. New challenges sprung forth, including unemployment, labour unrest and increasing militancy in Punjab. Rajiv Gandhi fuels Congress's resurgence and N.T. Rama Rao redefines Andhra's politics. Communal disharmony, anti-Sikh riots and Bofors scam defined the social climate. This was the first time in history no party enjoyed a majority in the Lok Sabha. Janata Dal’s V. P. Singh briefly led the National Front coalition. The ‘Mandir and Mandal’ politics stirred unrest across a polarised nation. Narasimha Rao rewrote India's economic policy, marking the beginning of the liberalisation era. The Babri Masjid demolition and Mandal Commission report injected a note of violent polarisation. Caste-based and regional politics came to power, as disillusionment with the now-disgraced Congress government grew. Elsewhere, corruption scandals and coalition instability bogged down the United Front government led by Janata Dal leaders. The House sat for its shortest-ever duration, hindered by coalition instability. Atal Bihari Vajpayee's leadership pushed the Bharatiya Janata Party to national prominence. The Kargil War boosted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's popularity. The 2001 Parliament breach, 2002 Gujarat riots and ideological fissures within the BJP later spelled trouble for the National Democratic Alliance. The Manmohan Singh-led government distinguished itself for a sustained economic growth, key legislation including the Right to Information Act and National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the historic Indo-U.S. Civil Nuclear Deal. The Congress-led UPA retained power, passing key legislation including the Right to Education Act and reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh. The government crumbled under the weight of economic slowdown and corruption scandals. The BJP rides on the popularity of the 'Modi Wave', with the promise of 'acche din' challenging the stasis and corruption of the incumbent Congress. Narendra Modi-led BJP government consolidates power. National security, COVID-19 pandemic, farmers' unrest, communal clashes, CAA protests and abrogation of Article...",1 week ago,1
India Records 65.4% Polling As Millions Vote In Round 1 Of General Election,"Poll body Election Commission, which is conducting the seven-phase exercise over the next 43 days, said in a statement, ""The Election Commission is working strenuously to ensure a smooth, transparent, and inclusive electoral process in the subsequent phases of General Elections 2024"".
Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, two states which also elected their assemblies today, recorded 68 and 68.3 per cent turnout. In 2019, 80.1 per cent people voted in Sikkim, 65.1 per cent in Arunachal Pradesh.
Tamil Nadu, one of the rare states that had a single-day election, saw 67.2 per cent voting, down from 72.4 per cent in 2019. Rajasthan, which along with Tamil Nadu accounts for half of the 102 seats that went to polls today, recorded 57.3 per cent voting -- down from 64 per cent.
At 7 pm, Uttar Pradesh recorded 59.5 per cent voting and Madhya Pradesh 66.7 per cent. One of the biggest turnouts, 77.6 per cent, was recorded in Bengal, where the BJP is hoping to close the gap with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress. In 2019, the BJP won 18 of the state's 42 seats.
The BJP-dominated northeastern states saw high turnout -- Assam 72.3 per cent, Meghalaya 74.5 per cent, Manipur 69.2 per cent Arunachal Pradesh 67.7 per cent and tiny Tripura a whopping 80.6 per cent.
In Bengal, Trinamool Congress and BJP workers clashed in Cooch Behar and accused each other of violence, intimidating voters and assault on poll agents, news agency PTI reported. The police denied any violence took place. In Manipur, a burst of gunfire was reported from a polling station in Bishnupur. In Imphal East district, a polling station was vandalised. In Tamil Nadu, two elderly people -- one a 77-year-old woman -- died at polling booths in Salem district.
The BJP, which has been projecting huge confidence about a third consecutive term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had won only 50 per cent of the seats up for grabs today in the last general election. The NDA had won 41 of these seats and the UPA 45. Six of the seats have been redrawn as part of delimitation.
For its target of 370 seats, the BJP is heavily banking on south, Karnataka and especially Tamil Nadu -- where it is yet to open its account -- and Bengal. In an exclusive interview to NDTV today, Union minister and the BJP's chief strategist Amit Shah said PM Modi's popularity ""will translate into our best showing in the south"".  
The Congress, pushed out of much of north India, insists it is on the cusp of a comeback. Senior leader KC Venugopal has said the party will post improved performance in most northern states - including the BJP bastions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. With assembly poll victories in Telangana and Karnataka, and the alliance with DMK in Tamil Nadu, it projects huge confidence about the results in the south.
The counting of votes will be held on June 4.

mean?","To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US April 18, 2024 08:54 pm | Updated April 22, 2024 10:38 am IST Election symbols and their creative use have always been a key feature to look out for as India’s election season heats up. | Photo Credit: The Hindu While in Vijayawada’s Kristurajupuram, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) workers raise a bicycle up in the air, elsewhere in Western Uttar Pradesh’s Nagina, supporters of Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) carry large kettles on their heads. Election symbols and their creative use have always been a key feature to look out for as India’s election season heats up. Also read: 2024 general elections LIVE Updates April 22 Since the very first elections in 1951, when at least 53 parties contested for about 4,500 seats (including Lok Sabha and State Assembly seats), the Election Commission has allotted symbols to parties under which a candidate can contest the election. This process became more streamlined with The Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 that stipulates the allotment of symbols to parties at a national and State level, as well as to independent candidates. It also has rules that can be applied in case of a merger of two or more parties, or a split in a party. Supporter of Azad Samaj Party (ASP) (Kanshi Ram), holding the party’s symbol ‘Kettle’ during door-to-door campaigning for the general elections in the Nagina Lok Sabha constituency, Bijnor district, Western Uttar Pradesh on April 6, 2024. | Photo Credit: The Hindu Such mergers, splits, breakaways have not only given the voters new symbols for this elections, but have dictated how even the most recognisable symbols — Congress’ hand or BJP’s lotus — came about to be. Read more on: Elections that shaped India Here’s a quick roundup of how some of the parties in this country ended up with their current symbols. In an early recording, Mohammed Rafi opens a simple Hindi song with a simple jingle “Congress ko vote dein, Congress ko vote dein” (Give your vote to Congress). The campaign song, which charts Congress’ role in the freedom struggle, points the voters to the party’s first election symbol — a pair of yoked bulls. “Do bailon ki jodi wala, Congress ka amit nishaan, jis ke peeche bhara pada azaadi ka itihass mahan,” (Congress’ symbol of a pair of bulls, that carries the glorious history India’s freedom with it), Rafi reminds the voters in this song. The pair of bullocks, a representation of the agrarian economy that Jawaharlal Nehru had been handed the command of, would inspire his daughter Indira Gandhi when she set up her own rival faction in 1969. (Hear the song by Mohammed Rafi below. Credit: Internet Archive) Some of the early election symbols. Top row (L to R) : Congress - two bulls with yoke on; Socialist party - Tree; Forward Bloc (Ruikar) -Human hand; K.M.P. party - Hut. Bottom row (L to R) : Communist Party of India- Ears of corn and sickle; Revolutionary Socialist party - Spade and stoker; Krishikar Lok party - A cultivator winnowing grain; Jan Sangh - Lamp. After being expelled from the party in 1969 by then Congress president S. Nijalingappa, Indira Gandhi formed the Indian National Congress (Requisitionists). As dispute over the symbol (yoked pair of bullocks) arose, Indira Gandhi’s faction was allotted the symbol of a ‘cow nursing her calf’. As the Indira Gandhi faction contested elections under this new symbol, its rival faction and other Opposition parties raised objection claiming that the image of cow was being used to appeal to the Hindu religious sentiments. Dismissing a petition in 1972, the Gujarat High Court, however, held that “a pictoral representation of a cow or a calf did not symbolise the religion.” The issue of the symbol’s religious connotations was also raised in the case before the Supreme Court in 1975 (Smt. Indira Gandhi vs. Shri Raj Narain), in which Narain alleged that Indira had “made extensive appeals to the religious symbol of cow and calf.” Election symbol of Congress (R). Post-Emergency, as Indira Gandhi sought to regain electoral power in the ensuing elections, after facing defeat at the hands of the Janata Party led by Morarji Desai. Declaring the party under her command as the “real Congress”, Indira Gandhi announced the formation of Congress (Indira). With her ‘calf and cow’ symbol frozen following a 1979 split, Indira Gandhi was on the lookout for a new symbol, and was given the choice between several symbols by Election...",1 week ago,1

"How Jawaharlal Nehru won a third term in the 1962 elections, despite 
growing challenges","By the time the elections of 1962 came around, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had finetuned many of its procedures. The election saw the highest turnout of voters until then — and even though the Congress won decisively, the first clear instances of political criticism of the party became visible. This happened despite Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in his second term having overseen the successful liberation of Goa, Daman, and Diu in a military operation that ended more than 400 years of Portuguese rule over these territories. The first Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sukumar Sen retired in 1958, and was succeeded by KVK Sundaram. The big change in the 1962 election was the abolition of two-member seats, a system that was intended to provide representation to the general category in certain reserved (SC/ST) seats. In the first two elections, some constituencies — including Nehru’s Phulpur and Feroze Gandhi’s Rae Bareli — sent two members to Lok Sabha. (There was even a three-member seat in West Bengal in the first Lok Sabha.) In 1957, Congress heavyweight and the future President of India V V Giri came third in Parvathipuram, Andhra Pradesh, one of the two-member seats, behind two Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates. Around the country, SC/ST candidates were elected at nine single-member ‘general’ seats. Giri challenged the election of the second ST candidate, Dippala Suri Dora, in the Supreme Court, but got no relief. As the demand for restricting SC/ST reservation to single-member constituencies gained momentum, Parliament passed The Two-Member Constituencies (Abolition) Act, 1961. A second change in the 1962 election came as a consequence of the creation of the new states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960, and the Union Territories of Goa, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1961, and the accompanying realignment of administrative boundaries. Ten days, from February 16-25, is all it took for almost 21 crore Indians to vote for India’s third Lok Sabha. A total 1,985 candidates contested the election, in which 55.43% of the 21.63 crore electors cast their votes — well above the 47.54% turnout in the 1957 election. The best turnout in 1962 was in Nagapattinam (80.66%); the worst in Bhanjnagar, Orissa (12.04%). Votes were cast for 387 general, 76 SC, and 31 ST seats in Lok Sabha, and 3,121 seats in state Assemblies, including 693 reserved seats. The national parties were, besides the Congress, the Communist Party of India (CPI), Praja Socialist Party (PSP), and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), which was the precursor to today’s BJP. The practice of putting indelible ink on the voter’s left forefinger, seen in the first two elections, continued in 1962 as well. But an experiment with issuing photo identity cards was abandoned after a test before a byelection to the Calcutta South-West Lok Sabha seat was not successful. The counting of votes took longer than the polling — from February 25 to March 18, 1962. There were demands for recounts at the Gonda and Balrampur seats in UP. Congress candidates ultimately won both seats by small margins. The new Lok Sabha was constituted on April 2, 1962, after giving the old House time to wrap up essential pending work. By the middle of Nehru’s second term, the first criticisms of the Congress could be heard clearly. At the 1959 AICC session in Nagpur, Chaudhary Charan Singh, who was still in the Congress then, criticised the party’s Cooperative Farming Resolution, which proposed the pooling of individual land holdings without provisions for mechanisation of agriculture. Just before the election, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, the last Governor-General of India, merged his Indian National Democratic Congress with some smaller groups in Bihar and Himachal Pradesh to form the Swatantra Party, which was recognised as a state party in six states. However, none of the Opposition parties managed to dent the Congress electorally in 1962. The party won 361 seats in Lok Sabha; the next biggest party in the House was CPI with 29, followed by BJS with 14. Thirty-five women were elected. In the Assembly elections, the Congress returned to power in all states except Kerala. Barring Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it got clear majorities everywhere. Ram Manohar Lohia of the Socialist Party lost to Nehru in Phulpur. Vijayaraje Scindia, who contested on a Congress ticket, won in Gwalior. Among the Opposition leaders, J B Kripalani contested from Bombay City (North) as an Independent and lost. Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the BJS lost both in Balrampur and Lucknow, but was subsequently elected to Rajya Sabha. Vajpayee’s...",6 days ago,1
"Lok Sabha battle round 1, breaking down the contest: 102 seats, 21 states 
and UTs, 1625 candidates","After months of build-up, the Lok Sabha polls get underway on Friday, with 102 seats spread across 21 states voting. Eleven states and Union Territories will complete polling by the end of Friday, including all 39 seats in Tamil Nadu, all five seats in Uttarakhand, 12 constituencies in Rajasthan, five in Maharashtra, and all seats in six Northeastern states and three UTs. The Assemblies in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim are also going to polls. Of the 102 seats, 18 are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 11 for Scheduled Tribes. In 2019, the parties that now constitute the INDIA bloc and the NDA (in its current configuration) each won 48 of these seats, with the unaligned BSP and AIADMK winning three and one seat, respectively. The undivided Shiv Sena and NCP won a seat each. In terms of vote share, the parties of the INDIA bloc secured 41.7% across these seats (excluding the five in Maharashtra, owing to the split in the NCP and Shiv Sena) compared to the NDA’s 34%. In 2019, the BJP alone won 40 of these 102 seats across 12 states, followed by the DMK at 24 in Tamil Nadu, and the Congress at 15 in eight states. There will be 1,625 candidates in the fray on Friday. Given that all seats in Tamil Nadu are going to polls, most of the candidates (950) are from the state. Among the parties, the BSP has fielded the most candidates at 86, followed by the BJP at 77, and the Congress at 56. Of the 251 candidates with criminal cases, 137 are in Tamil Nadu, followed by 28 in Uttar Pradesh. But in terms of the share of candidates with criminal cases, UP tops the first phase list at 35%, followed by Nagaland at 33% and Meghalaya at 30%. Sikkim, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Manipur have no candidates with pending cases. In six of the states and UTs going to polls, more than one-fourth of the candidates are facing cases. The BJP has the highest number of candidates facing cases at 28 among the parties. BJP: 28 candidates (36% of all party candidates) Congress: 19 (34%) DMK, AIADMK: 13 each (59%, 36%) BSP, NTK: 11 each (13%, 28%) PMK: 6 (60%) Of the 450 candidates who are crorepatis, again Tamil Nadu has the highest share (202), followed by Rajasthan (37) and Maharashtra (36). But in terms of share of candidates, Meghalaya has the most crorepatis at 70%, followed by Mizoram and Nagaland at 67%, and Arunachal Pradesh at 64%. The BJP has the most crorepatis at 69 or 90% of all their candidates, followed by the Congress at 49 or 88%. Nakul Nath, Congress | Contesting from Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh | Assets: Rs 717 crore Ashok Kumar, AIADMK | Contesting from Erode, Tamil Nadu | Assets: Rs 663 crore Dhevanathan Yadav T, BJP | Contesting from Sivaganga, Tamil Nadu | Assets: Rs 305 crore In 2019, just 10 women won from these 102 seats. Of the 135 women candidates in Phase 1, Tamil Nadu has the highest share at 76, but they account for just 8% of the candidates in the state. In the first phase, the share of women candidates is well below one-third, which is the proportion of seats set to be reserved for women in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies through the recently passed Women’s Reservation Act, 2023. In Meghalaya, 20% of the candidates are women. In six states and UTs, there are no women candidates at all.

The affidavits filed by the top leaders of various political parties revealed certain interesting facts, one among them being not owning any latest four-wheeler.
TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu declared that he owned an Ambassador car purchased in 1994.
Mr. Naidu declared that the Ambassador car worth ₹2.22 lakh was registered in his name. He further declared that his wife Bhuvaneswari did not have a car or any other vehicle.
YSRCP president and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy declared that he had no car of his own.

His wife Bharati too had no vehicle in her name.
Similarly, BJP State president Daggubati Purandeswari declared that neither she nor her husband D. Venkateswara Rao owned any vehicle in their names.
In the same way, APCC chief Y.S. Sharmila, who is contesting from Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency, too said in her affidavit that there were no vehicles registered in her and her husband M. Anil Kumar’s names.
Former Chief Minister of combined Andhra Pradesh and BJP leader Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy, who is contesting from Rajampet Lok Sabha constituency, stated that two cars — Hyundai and Honda Amaze — were in the name of his wife N. Radhika Reddy. The cars are worth more than ₹19 lakh.
TDP national general secretary and contestant from Mangalagiri Assembly constituency Nara Lokesh, who is son of Mr. Naidu, declared that he owned a Ford Fiesta worth ₹8.44 lakh purchased in the year 2007. His wife Nara Brahmani had no vehicle registered in her name.
Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan, however, said in this affidavit that he owned 11 vehicles, which included nine cars. He is the pride owner of Harley Davidson-Heritage bike purchased in the year 2010 and worth ₹32,66,536. He also owned Benz R-Class 350, Mahindra Scorpio S8, Tata Yodha, Benz Maybach S-Class 560, Range Rover Sport, Toyota Land Cruiser, Toyota Vellfire, Jeep Wrangler, and Mahindra Scorpio S-11.

First phase polling sees 62.4% voter turnout in 102 LS seats,"Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on By Dalip Singh Comments READ LATER About 62.4 per cent aggregate voter turn out was reported on Friday from 102 Lok Sabha seats spread across 21 States and Union Territories (UTs), the Election Commission of India said on Friday after the polling for the first phase ended at 6 pm. The polling of over 62 per cent, as per the Election Commission of India official figure, is lower compared with the first phase of the previous Lok Sabha elections of 2019, where it stood at 69.43 per cent. According to the data released by the ECI at 7 pm, voting percentage of 77.57 was the highest in TMC-ruled West Bengal. The polling was brisk since the morning in the West Bengal, as the EC turnout figures showed that 50.96 per cent polling took place by 1 pm, itself in the State -- the second highest after Tripura which polled 53.04 per cent by that time. Interestingly, but for Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the Hindi heartland, where BJP’s performance had peaked last LS elections, remaining states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan, and hill state of Uttarakhand witnessed less than average polling recorded from the first phase of polling. Bihar polled the lowest votes at 47.49 per cent, Rajasthan was a bit better at 50.95 per cent, Uttar Pradesh 57.61 per cent, and Uttarakhand 53.64 per cent, as per the ECI. However, the voter turnout in Madhya Pradesh was 63.33 per cent and Chhattisgarh 63.41 per cent – both the states had seen assembly elections four months back. The voting in Tamil Nadu, a key southern state where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hopeful of BJP candidates performing exceedingly well, polled 62.19 per cent votes. However, the polling figures collected by the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Tamil Nadu varied with that of the ECI. “Our voting percentage by 5 p.m. is average 63.20 per cent for the state. Highest in Dharmapuri parliamentary constituency, 67.52 and minimum, 57.04 per cent in Chennai South,” CEO of Tamil Nadu Satyabrata Sahoo said. The polling figures, said the ECI, will be revised and final figures will be known on Saturday after the scrutiny of poll documents. The polling in North-eastern states was comparatively high. The maximum was in Tripura at 79.90 per cent followed by Assam 71.38 per cent, Meghalaya 70.26 per cent, Manipur 68.62 per cent, Sikkim 68.06 per cent, Nagaland 56.77 per cent, and Arunachal Pradesh 65.46 per cent. Similarly, the voting in Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, which will face assembly elections in a few months from now to restore the statehood, was 65.08 er cent and Puducherry 73.25 per cent. The ECI in a statement to media said the polling for the first phase of the general elections 2024 “recorded high voter turnout despite the heat wave”. “Polling remains largely peaceful with voters from various walks participating enthusiastically in a dazzling display of civic responsibility and pride,” said the ECI but reports of violence came from West Bengal, and Manipur. “Polling has remained by and large peaceful except for certain incidents that were reported from a few districts. We have received a few reports of some damage to the EVMs, some criminal intimidation or somebody trying to influence the voters. We are seeking reports from the districts and necessary action be taken once the reports are received... Our preparation for the second phase, which is going to happen on the 26th of April, also will start working on that now.” Manipur Chief Electoral Officer, Pradeep Jha, told local reporters. Voting was held in all seats of Tamil Nadu (39), Uttarakhand (5), Arunachal Pradesh (2), Meghalaya (2), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1), Mizoram (1), Nagaland (1), Puducherry (1), Sikkim (1) and Lakshadweep (1). While it took place in 12 of 25 seats in Rajasthan, 8 of 80 constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, 6 of 29 in Madhya Pradesh, and 4 of 40 in Bihar. Five seats each in Assam and Maharashtra, 3 in West Bengal, 2 in Manipur, and one seat each in Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh also went to polls in the first phase. The Commission led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu constantly monitored the progress of polling in Phase 1 across the constituencies from ECI Headquarters in Nirvachan Sadan where a state-of-the-art control room was set up for...",6 days ago,1

Explainer: India's Lok Sabha election 2024: What are the key issues?,Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker,1 week ago,1
India election 2024: Why does it matter and who can vote?,"Indian voters queue at a polling station to cast their votes in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh state, in 2019. Photo: SANJAY KANOJIA / AFP India's 2024 general election - to be held over six weeks between 19 April and 1 June - will be the biggest the world has ever seen. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hoping to win a third successive term, but opposition parties say Indians face the loss of many freedoms if he stays in power. Recent opinion polls suggest Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies will win the election for the Lok Sabha - the lower chamber of India's parliament - for a third time running. The Lok Sabha chooses the prime minister, who in turns chooses government ministers. The BJP won 303 seats in the 2019 election, and the coalition of parties it is in, the National Democratic Alliance, took 352 seats overall. The main challenge in 2024 comes from a coalition of political parties headed by the Indian National Congress, the biggest opposition party. More than two dozen parties have joined it to form the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (""India"" for short). Key politicians in this group include Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, as well as siblings Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, whose father was the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Their mother, Sonia Gandhi, is a powerful opposition leader but is not expected to campaign as hard as she did in 2019. Delhi's governing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is part of the coalition, along with several important regional parties. Three AAP leaders have been recently arrested, accused of corruption. The party accuses Modi and the BJP of conducting a political vendetta against it, which the BJP denies. Modi can claim India's global standing has risen thanks to its growing economy and closer relations with the US, which wants India to be its ally against China. He has recently introduced generous welfare schemes, such as providing free grain to 800 million of India's poorest, and a monthly stipend of 1,250 rupees ($25) to women from low-income families. In its manifesto, Congress argues that unemployment remains high, especially for young people. And it promises increased welfare payments for women, 3 million extra government jobs and more apprenticeships for college leavers. It also promises that it will stop India's ""slide into autocracy"". Minority groups say that they often face discrimination and attacks, and have been forced to live as ""second-class"" citizens under Modi's rule - an allegation the BJP denies. The campaign group for international civil liberties, Freedom House, says that journalists and others who question the BJP government have increasingly been harassed. It classifies India as only ""partly free"". Voting is taking place in different parts of India on seven polling days: 19 April, 26 April, 7 May, 13 May, 20 May, 25 May and 1 June. The results will be announced on 4 June. Voting is staggered to enable security staff to guard polling stations across the country. Millions of electronic voting machines will be used, which let people choose between candidates or pick ""none of the above"". Election officials and security personnel carry electronic voting machines and other materials to a polling station in Golaghat district, India, on 18 April. Photo: ANUWAR HAZARIKA / AFP India is the world's most populous country, with 1.4 billion inhabitants, and 969 million of them can vote in this year's election - roughly one in eight of the global population. Voters must be Indian citizens, 18 years of age or older and be on the electoral register. They also need valid voter ID cards. The 13.4 million Indian citizens who live abroad can also vote, but must register and return to India to do so. There are 543 elected MPs in the Lok Sabha, and an individual party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to form a majority to govern. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected for a five-year term to represent a single constituency, the winner being the candidate with the most votes. There are 131 seats reserved for MPs from so-called ""scheduled castes"" and ""scheduled tribes"". These are groups officially recognised as disadvantaged, and make up about a quarter of India's population. India has also passed a law to allocate a third of the seats to women, but this will not come into force for several years. India is 3.3 million square kilometres in area, and electoral rules say there must be a polling booth close to every human habitation. The 2019 elections...",1 week ago,1

"Maryland teacher arrested after principal allegedly framed with 
AI-generated racist rant","Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time A Maryland high school teacher was arrested after he allegedly used artificial intelligence to create phony audio, planting racist and antisemitic words into the voice of his boss, authorities said Thursday. Dazhon Darien, a physical education teacher and the athletic director at Pikesville High School, was accused of falsifying the voice of principal Eric Eiswert in January, authorities said. ""We now have conclusive evidence that the recording was not authentic,"" Baltimore County Police Chief Robert McCullough told reporters in Towson. ""It’s been determined the recording was generated through the use of artificial intelligence technology."" Darien was charged with disrupting school activities and other counts. ""As you could imagine, this has been a very difficult time for [the] Pikesville High School community, principal Eiswert and his family,"" Baltimore County Public Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said. A judge signed on Wednesday afternoon an arrest warrant for Darien, who was caught Thursday morning at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Darien was scheduled to fly to Houston when security questioned whether he had properly packed his gun for travel, McCullough said. Darien's name was run through police records, and the warrant showed up, leading to his arrest, McCullough added. McCullough stopped short of saying whether Darien was seeking to flee. Darien was also charged with theft, retaliation against a witness and stalking. He and Eiswert had been at odds over “work performance challenges” with Darien’s contract possibly “not being renewed next semester,” according to the arrest warrant. ""Through their investigation, detectives allege that Mr. Darien, who was athletic director at the high school, made the recording to retaliate against the principal, who had launched an investigation into the potential mishandling of school funds,"" McCullough said. Eiswert had been following up on a $1,916 payment Darien allegedly authorized for an assistant girls soccer coach, who the head coach and players said never assisted the team, police said. Eiswert had also reprimanded Darien for terminating a coach without his approval, police said. Eiswert was widely admonished when the viral audio seemed to capture him spewing hateful rhetoric, mocking Black and Jewish people. The voice initially believed to have been Eiswert's said Black students were unable to ""test their way out of a paper bag,"" according to the court document. ""The recording went on to make disparaging comments about Jewish individuals and two teachers ... who 'should have never been hired' at the school,"" the warrant said. Eiswert has always insisted that the recording, which was sent to Darien and two other teachers the night of Jan. 16, was fake. The audio spread quickly on social media and ""had profound repercussions,"" causing ""significant disruptions for the PHS staff and students,"" according to the arrest warrant. Eiswert has been on paid administrative leave since the recording went viral. District appointees have run the school since Eiswert's departure, and the temporary administrators will stay on the job through the end of the school year, Rogers said. ""We will work with principal Eiswert and the Pikesville community concerning next year,"" Rogers added. Investigators linked the email TJFOUST9@gmail.com, which was used to send the audio, to an internet service provider registered to Darien's grandmother, according to the warrant. The recovery phone number for the Google account had a 213 area code, registered to Darien, a Southern California native, police said. A forensic analyst contracted by the FBI also found that the recording ""contained traces of AI-generated content with human editing after the fact,"" the arrest warrant said. Darien was shown to have used the Baltimore County Public Schools' network to access OpenAI tools and Microsoft Bing Chat services on Dec. 18 and 19 and Jan. 15, a day before the audio clip was sent out, police said. Darien and his family could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. The school district will seek to fire Darien, Rogers said. Eiswert could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday. A rep for the principal’s union said he’s relieved that “responsible people are being held accountable,” but is worried that harm caused by the fake audio could be long-lasting. “I continue to be concerned about the damage these actions have caused for Principal Eiswert, his family, the students and staff of Pikesville High School, and the Black and Jewish community members,” Council of Administrative and Supervisory Employee executive director Billy Burke said in a statement. “I hope there is deliberate action to heal the...",1 hour ago,1

A look at the Gaza war protests that have emerged on US college campuses,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Atlanta police and Georgia state troopers dismantled a camp on Emory University’s quadrangle Thursday morning, with Associated Press journalists counting at least 17 people detained. (AP video by Sharon Johnson) Student protests over the Israel-Hamas war have popped up on an increasing number of college campuses following last week’s arrest of more than 100 demonstrators at Columbia University. The students are calling for universities to separate themselves from any companies that are advancing Israel’s military efforts in Gaza — and in some cases from Israel itself. Protests on many campuses have been orchestrated by coalitions of student groups. The groups largely act independently, though students say they’re inspired by peers at other universities. A look at protests on campuses in recent days: Pro-Palestinian student protesters set up a tent encampment at the Ivy League university in New York last week. Police first tried to clear the encampment on April 18, when they arrested more than 100 protesters. But the move backfired, inspiring students across the country and motivating protesters at Columbia to regroup. University officials said Wednesday they were extending a deadline for protesters to clear out. They said the demonstrators had committed to removing a significant number of tents and agreed only students would remain at the encampment. They also agreed to ban any discriminatory language or harassing messages. Ben Chang, a spokesperson for Columbia, said Thursday that discussions with student protesters were continuing. He said university leaders hope the talks lead demonstrators to remove the encampment, but otherwise Columbia will have to consider other options. “We have our demands; they have theirs,” he said. Columbia officials said that negotiations were showing progress as the school’s self-imposed early Friday deadline to reach an agreement on dismantling the encampment came and went. Nevertheless, two police buses were parked nearby and there was a noticeable presence of private security and police at entrances to the campus. The University of Southern California has canceled its main stage graduation ceremony as its campus is roiled by protests. The university already canceled a commencement speech by the school’s pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns. The Los Angeles Police Department said more than 90 people were arrested Wednesday night for alleged trespassing during a protest at the university. One person was arrested for alleged assault with a deadly weapon. There were no reports of injuries. The university said Wednesday it had closed campus and police would arrest people who did not leave. Police clashed with protesters at Ohio State University in Columbus, just hours after they gathered Thursday evening. Those who refused to leave after warnings were arrested and charged with criminal trespass, said university spokesperson Benjamin Johnson, citing rules barring overnight events. Johnson did not have an exact number of arrests. The University of Texas campus was much calmer on Thursday, a day after a demonstration saw police and state troopers in riot gear and on horseback make dozens of arrests and force hundreds of students off the school’s main lawn. On Thursday, university officials pulled back the campus barricades and allowed another demonstration involving students and some faculty on the main square underneath the school’s iconic clock tower. The group was also protesting the Wednesday arrests. No violence erupted as a small group of campus police watched from the steps of the tower building. The gathering lasted about two hours. University President Jay Hartzell said Thursday that 26 of the 55 people arrested Wednesday had no affiliation with the university. About 50 students at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., set up a tent encampment on the school’s University Yard on Thursday. Later in the day, a group of Georgetown University students and professors staged their own protest walkout and marched to the George Washington campus to join the protesters there. The protestors are demanding that the university divest from all relations with Israel and lift a suspension against a prominent pro-Palestinian student group. The university was moving law school finals, which were set to be held in a building next to the encampment, to another building because of the noise. The university said the protesters must remove tents and disperse by 7 p.m. Protesters stayed overnight at the encampment, local news stations reported Friday morning. In a statement after the Thursday evening deadline, the university in Washington said the encampment violated university policies and that the administration and police were figuring out how to address the situation. Trying to stay ahead of protests, Harvard University...",33 minutes ago,1

Muhlenberg College has earned a STARS Gold rating in recognition of its sustainability achievements from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). STARS, the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, measures and encourages sustainability in all aspects of higher education.  
""The AASHE STARS award is a total campus certification and requires an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together individuals from almost every department and office on campus,” says Sustainability Specialist Natalie Sobrinski. “We are incredibly grateful for the hard work and commitment of our staff, students and faculty who have contributed their expertise and passion to this effort. This achievement demonstrates Muhlenberg's shared commitment to sustainability and sets a high standard for our future initiatives.""
Muhlenberg has earned a STARS Gold Rating previously, for a submission in 2018 that was valid through 2021. In 2019, AASHE made its standards more stringent; this is the first time the College has earned Gold under these standards.
Some sustainability initiatives that factored into the STARS Gold rating include:
With more than 900 participants in 40 countries, AASHE’s STARS program is the most widely recognized framework in the world for publicly reporting comprehensive information related to a college or university’s sustainability performance. Participants report achievements in five overall areas: 1) academics 2) engagement, 3) operations, 4) planning and administration, and 5) innovation and leadership. 
Muhlenberg’s STARS report is publicly available here.

"News Release: NREL Proof of Concept Shows Path to Easier Recycling of Solar 
Modules | News","The use of femtosecond lasers to form glass-to-glass welds for solar modules would
                     make the panels easier to recycle, according to a proof-of-concept study conducted
                     by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory
                     (NREL).
The welds would eliminate the need for plastic polymer sheets that are now laminated
                     into solar modules but make recycling more difficult. At the end of their useful lifespan,
                     the modules made with the laser welds can be shattered. The glass and metal wires
                     running through the solar cells can be easily recycled and the silicon can be reused.
“Most recyclers will confirm that the polymers are the main issue in terms of inhibiting
                     the process of recycling,” said David Young, senior scientist and group manager for
                     the High-Efficiency Crystalline Photovoltaics group in the Chemistry and Nanoscience
                     department at NREL. Young is lead author of a new paper outlining the use of laser
                     welds for solar modules. The paper, “Towards Polymer-Free, Femto-Second Laser-Welded Glass/Glass Solar Modules,” appears in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
Written with NREL colleagues Tim Silverman, Nicholas Irvin, and Nick Bosco, the paper
                     also counts as its coauthors two employees of Trumpf Inc., the California company
                     that made the femtosecond laser involved. A femtosecond laser uses a short pulse of
                     infrared light that melts the glass together to form a strong, hermetic seal.
The glass weld can be used on any type of solar technology—silicon, perovskites, cadmium
                     telluride—because the heat of the weld is confined to a few millimeters from the laser
                     focus. 
Solar modules are made of semiconductors designed to capture a specific portion of
                     the solar spectrum, harnessing sunlight to create electricity. Typically, the semiconductors
                     are sandwiched between two sheets of glass laminated together with polymer sheets.
                     
NREL’s research showed that femtosecond laser, glass/glass welds are essentially as
                     strong as the glass itself.
“As long as the glass doesn’t break, the weld is not going to break,” he said. “However,
                     not having the polymers between the sheets of glass requires welded modules to be
                     much stiffer. Our paper showed that with proper mounting and a modification to the
                     embossed features of the rolled glass, a welded module can be made stiff enough to
                     pass static load testing.”
NREL’s research is the first to use a femtosecond laser to form glass/glass welds
                     for use in a module. A different type of edge sealing using nanosecond lasers and
                     a glass frit filler was tried in the past, but the welds proved too brittle for use
                     in outdoor module designs. The femtosecond laser welds offer superior strength with
                     hermetic sealing at a compelling cost. 
Young said the research is “definitely high risk, high reward,” but points to a direction
                     for further research to extend the life of solar modules to beyond 50 years and to
                     allow easier recycling. 
This research was done through the Durable Module Materials Consortium, which is led
                  by NREL and funded through the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies

"NFL Draft 2024 live updates: 1st round picks so far, trades, grades as 
Caleb Williams goes No. 1, six QBs taken in first ...","The first round of the 2024 NFL Draft is in the books and it was the most offensive-heavy first round in the history of the annual player selection meeting. 23 offensive players — highlighted by 14-in-a-row to start the draft — was an all-time record. While there was little drama with the first pick, where Caleb Williams went to Chicago, heads turned at the tail end of the top 10 when the Atlanta Falcons picked quarterback Michael Penix Jr. in the most surprising pick of the night. The Falcons signed Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract earlier this offseason. Quarterbacks also tied a record with six of them going in the first round, matching the legendary 1983 class. All of the quarterbacks went in the top 12, culminating with Bo Nix to Denver with that 12th pick. Next up on Friday, are rounds two and three of the NFL Draft, and the Buffalo Bills have pick No. 33 overall, and will get the draft going again at 7 p.m. ET from Detroit. April 26 — Second and third rounds, 7 p.m. ETApril 27 — Fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rounds, noon ET The 2024 NFL Draft will be broadcast live on NFL Network and also ESPN, ABC and ESPN Deportes. You can stream it on ESPN+, YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. It's being held in the area around Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza in downtown Detroit, less than a mile from Ford Field, home of the Lions. Right here on Yahoo Sports' 2024 NFL Draft page. Draft Grade: C+ Pre-Draft Rank: 76 School: South Carolina Height: 6' 1"" Weight: 221 This is a fine pick for the Panthers. They probably didn’t need to trade up, but moving up one spot to secure your guy isn’t the worst move in the world. They also needed to add a bigger player to their wide receiver room. This is solid pickup for the Panthers who really needed juice on offense. Draft Grade: D Pre-Draft Rank: 85 School: Florida Height: 6' 1"" Weight: 189 Huh? This pick seems a bit out of nowhere, especially considering no one really had Pearsall going at this point in the draft. Perhaps this is the 49ers bracing for a move at wide receiver, but Pearsall could have been had later than this. Draft Grade: B- Pre-Draft Rank: 31 School: Clemson Height: 6' 1"" Weight: 173 Baltimore definitely has a need for a cornerback, but it took a bit of a project at the position at this point in the draft. Wiggins is a rangy, fast corner, but he needs to add weight and strength before he can be a real contributor for the Ravens defense. Draft Grade: C+ Pre-Draft Rank: 37 School: Oklahoma Height: 6' 8"" Weight: 322 The Cowboys needed a left tackle to develop and at least have a prospect now in Guyton. He’s got a bit of a way to go as far as technique is concerned, but the physical tools and frame to grow into something for the long term are there. Guyton might have a lower floor than some of the other tackle prospects, but the upside is still here. 🚨 Final pick of the first round 🚨 Panthers swap picks with the Bills to select WR Xavier Legette pic.twitter.com/iM8at5c3N6 — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) April 26, 2024 The 49ers add a WR with pick No. 31 👀 pic.twitter.com/FW4oPIkHxn — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) April 26, 2024 Draft Grade: C+ Pre-Draft Rank: 63 School: Texas Height: 5' 11"" Weight: 165 The Chiefs add some speed to their wide receiver room and some playmaking for Patrick Mahomes. This does feel a tad redundant with Marquise Brown on the roster, but that's only a one-year deal. Mahomes solves all problems, and having Rashee Rice on the roster is a nice changeup from the Brown and Worthy combo, but a 165-pound player in the first round is a bit of a tough sell.

"SPORTS FEEVER â April 25, 2024","SPORTS FEEVER by Chris Fee of KROX Radio – chrisjfee@yahoo.com I apologize for missing last week’s column; I completely forgot about it last week until it was too late to get something going. — — — In the last column, we told you about Crookston Girls Basketball Head Coach Darin Zimmerman moving to Detroit Lakes to take a teaching job there and Brett Brendan also moving to Detroit Lakes to take a job there. This week, we have more news on Crookston coaching. The long-time Crookston Pirate Boys Basketball head coach Greg Garmen handed in his resignation, and the Crookston School Board approved it. Greg has been the Pirate Boys Basketball coach for 29 years! He was coach when Crookston was in 8AAA and of course while they were in 8AA. The highlight for Greg and the Pirates Boys Basketball program in the last 29 years would have to be the Class AA state runner-up year in 2005. Crookston made it to the championship even though the Pirates were without their leading scorer, Kenley Wahlin (now A.D. at Ada-Borup-West), who tore his ACL during the section championship game. It was a huge accomplishment to win the section while beating some great teams, including Pelican Rapids, in the section championship. Greg is a great coach and a great person who wanted his players to be great students, good people, respectful, and to represent the team and town well at all times. He was always checking if kids had their grades up and would make sure the boys would get their schoolwork done. He also taught them responsibility and accountability. Any kid who went through the Pirate Boys Basketball program is a better person because of it. Greg was always great to KROX. He rarely ever missed a coaches corner program. He always gave us interviews or anything that we needed. He was always top-notch, and I appreciated it. He also let me know what was going on with my sons and even daughters when he was teaching and coaching. He cared about the kids and was always looking out for them. He had to deal with both of my sons, who were sometimes challenging with their attitudes. It is truly the end of an era for Pirate Boys Basketball. I would like to thank Greg publicly for all the time he put into the program, my boys. Coaching isn’t easy and I don’t remember him ever having any major issues with parents over the 29 years. A big thank you to Greg, from all of us at KROX. We have APPRECIATED EVERYTHING you have done! So with that said here is the coaching openings right now for Pirates athletics. Girls Hockey – all coaches Boys Basketball – all coaches Girls basketball – Head, and assistant coach — — — One thing Crookston won’t be looking for is a swimming coach after the Crookston School Board finally elected to drop the Girl’s Swimming program. They only had one girl compete on the varsity level last year, and it just happened to be Sophomore Chloe Boll, who went to state in two events. I think Chloe had a pretty good sense that it was a possibility and really wanted to make it to state last fall. I think the only surprise that comes from anybody is people that don’t know a darn thing or the fact that Crookston finally cut a sport that has had low numbers for a decade-plus (only having one girl this year, with one that was injured most of the year). While I feel bad for Chloe Boll, she can easily go back to tennis, or she can easily play volleyball or soccer and probably be a main cog on any of the three teams she chooses. While it is tough to see a team get cut, it should come as no surprise to anybody. It was a thought for swimmers, especially after the school handed over control of the pool to the city. Superintendent Randy Bergquist said it will save the school district about $40,000 next school year by not having girls swimming. That is a lot of money to spend for one or two people. — — — Here is some quick thoughts on who I see as the top spring sports teams so far this spring.

The Most Valuable Combat Sports Promotions 2024,"For decades, boxing was the dominant combat sport as fighters like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Evander Holyfield became household names. In recent years, MMA has caught up to the sweet science with Alex Pereira, Dustin Poirier, and Conor McGregor joining Canelo Alvarez, Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua as fighters who can headline cards that sell out arenas and get a million pay-per-view buys. Even professional wrestling—long derided as sports entertainment because it is scripted—has grown more formidable over the past decade. The 2019 addition of All Elite Wrestling (AEW) provided World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) with its first true rival since WWE purchased World Championship Wrestling in 2001. With all three categories becoming more mainstream, MMA, boxing, and wrestling promotions are all fighting for much of the same audience and have been making a dash for cash to fuel growth. With the fight game getting bigger and the top promotions drawing real capital, the combat sports industry has become a winner’s game, as competitive outside the ring (or Octagon) as it is once the bell rings. The most high-profile moment in the combat sports battle royale has been the merger and subsequent IPO of UFC and WWE—first and second on this inaugural list—under the name TKO Holdings in September 2023. To understand how big each of the companies were separately, consider this: UFC holds some 40 events annually, reaching more than 900 million households on television across 170-plus countries, while WWE stages more than 200 live events annually, with televised events reaching at least one billion people on a weekly basis in more than 180 countries. The two brands each had media rights revenue of over $800 million, more than triple the total revenue of all the other promotions on the list. To make the $11.3 billion value of UFC even more eyepopping, consider that Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta purchased UFC for just $2 million in 2001. Then in 2016, Endeavor bought the company for $4 billion, marking a 72% annual return each year the Fertittas held ownership. In terms of pay, however, boxers are still making the bigger bucks, with Canelo Alvarez and Anthony Joshua both landing on Forbes’ Highest Paid Athletes List. No MMA fighters appeared on the 2023 list, although that may change going forward after a settlement in March that will require UFC to pay $335 million to former fighters who alleged the promotion restricted their ability to maximize earnings. For MMA fighters looking to maximize their earnings outside UFC, its competitors have also made some significant moves recently. One of the fastest growing companies in combat sports is Singapore-based ONE Championship, which has raised more than $500 million in capital from funding rounds since 2014. ONE has focused on growing globally and has media deals that allow its product to reach more than 190 countries. Additionally, ONE has been seeking to grow its live events portfolio as well, having had a successful launch in the United States last year at a sold-out Denver event, then launching its first Qatar promotion earlier this year. The Qataris have also played a key role in One’s growth as a major player in its latest funding round. Professional Fighters League (PFL) owner Donn Davis didn’t want to be the only MMA promotion left behind so last November he acquired rival Bellator after receiving a $100 million investment from the new arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), known as SRJ (and pronounced Surge). The acquisition of Bellator gave PFL a larger stable of fighters, in addition to the signings of social media star and celebrity boxer Jake Paul, and former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou. While PFL is in direct competition with UFC, its structure is designed much like the four major North American sports leagues, with a regular season, playoffs, and eventual crowning of a champion at season’s end, and so far it is resonating with fans. In just its fifth year, PFL’s ratings increased 45% year-over-year on ESPN and ESPN+, with an average of 509,000 viewers per regular season event, roughly half of the average UFC event viewership. Perhaps the biggest indicator that boxing, MMA and wrestling are achieving parity is how many fighters are blurring the lines. Among the most anticipated fights of the past decade was in 2017, when MMA star Conor McGregor laced up boxing gloves to square off against retired champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. More recently, heavyweight champion Tyson Fury defeated former former UFC champ Francis Ngannou last October in a controversial...",1 week ago,1
"College basketball transfer portal 2024: Ranking top 75 players as Tyrese 
Hunter commits to Memphis","Play Now Men's Brackets Play Now Women's Brackets A Daily SportsLine Betting Podcast NFL Draft is coming up! Miami's Wooga Poplar hit the transfer portal on Thursday with less than a week to spare until the May 1 deadline for players to enter. The 6-foot-5 guard and former four-star prospect started 65 games for the Hurricanes over the past two seasons, playing a key role in Miami's 2023 Final Four run before increasing his contributions this past season. Poplar averaged 13.1 points per game for the 'Canes in 2023-24 while shooting 38.5 of his 3-point attempts on 5.6 tries per game. That demonstrated track record of perimeter shooting will make Poplar a coveted player in college basketball free agency. The Philadelphia native is also a skilled driver with the shiftiness and athleticism to finish in the lane and in transition. While he didn't rate as a great defender for Miami this past season, Poplar has the size and physical tools to be an impact defender. He will have one seasons of eligibility remaining. With the spring portal window closing on May 1, those wishing to transfer are running short on time to declare their intentions. But so long as players have entered the portal by that date, they face no firm deadline on when they must commit to their new school. Those who are exploring the NBA Draft process have through May 29 to withdraw if they want to return to college next season. When players hit the portal, the best will be ranked here. Check out the latest transfer portal updates from 247Sports Old school: FAU Davis played a key role in taking FAU to the 2023 Final Four and built on his breakout season by upping his scoring average to 18.2 points in 2023-24. The 6-4 guard hit 41.4% of his 3-pointers, pulled down 6.3 rebounds and averaged 1.4 steals for the Owls in his fourth season of college basketball. He's only got one season left to play and is also testing the NBA Draft waters. Old school: Drake | New school: West Virginia DeVries won Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year twice during three seasons while playing for his father, Darian DeVries. The 6-7 wing averaged 21.6 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game in 2023-24. He's a career 35.9% 3-point shooter and dynamic offensive threat. DeVries is following his father, who accepted the West Virginia job. Old school: Wisconsin | New school: Kansas Storr provided a significant jolt of offense for Wisconsin in the 2023-24 season, averaging 16.8 points. The 6-6 wing is a multi-level scorer with the size needed to finish in the paint and around the rim. being surrounded by other dynamic playmakers at Kansas should allow Storr increase his efficiency after he shot 43.4% from the floor for the Badgers. Old school: Duke | New school: Baylor Roach is a seasoned floor general with two years of experience under Mike Krzyzewski and two years of experience under Jon Scheyer. The 6-1 guard earned third-team All-ACC honors in 2023-24 while averaging 14 points and 3.3 assists per game on 42.9% 3-point shooting. With 108 starts for a premier program under his belt, Roach will be a plug and play replacement for RayJ Dennis, who is out of eligibility after playing a similar one-year rental role at point guard for the Bears in 2023-24. Old school: Duke | New school: Missouri Mitchell started 67 games in his two seasons at Duke after ranking as a five-star prospect in the Class of 2022. The 6-9 forward is a dynamic athlete who played mostly at small forward in 2022-23 before sliding to power forward this past season. He averaged 11.6 points and 6.0 rebounds per game on 54% shooting from the floor this past year. With two seasons of eligibility remaining and NBA-caliber upside, Mitchell could blossom into a star for a rebuilding Missouri team. Old school: FAU Goldin averaged 15.7 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game on an insanely efficient 67.3% shooting from the floor for FAU in 2023-24. The 7-1 Russian is a rugged and seasoned veteran who impacts both ends of the floor. He is a particularly strong asset on offense, despite the fact that he's never attempted a 3-pointer. Old school: Arizona | New school: Indiana Ballo's size (7-foot and 260 pounds) makes him a difficult player for opponents to manage. He averaged 12.9 points and 10.1 rebounds in 2023-24 for Arizona on 65.8% shooting. There isn't much versatility...",1 week ago,1
Ranked: The World's Most Valuable Sports Teams in 2024,,1 month ago,1
Ranked: Top 10 NIL earners in college sports,"As University of Iowa basketball star Caitlin Clark continues her March Madness run, she's garnered attention for both her record-breaking performances and her ability to translate that on-court success into lucrative deals with major brands like Nike, Gatorade, and State Farm. ""There's a significant uptick in interest in March Madness sponsorships and influencer-marketing campaigns this year as compared to years past,"" Ayden Syal, CEO of NIL marketing platform MOGL, told Business Insider in March 2024. Name, image, and likeness deals — or NIL deals — have become a billion-dollar industry since their introduction to amateur sports in 2021, allowing student-athletes to make significant amounts of money regardless of whether they have the option to turn pro. On3 tracks these partnerships and ranks student-athletes weekly based on their annual NIL Valuation, which is determined by an algorithm that considers a player's roster value performance, influence, exposure, and deal data. These four factors determine an athlete's ""Roster Value"" — ""a calculation of an athlete's respective value to their team,"" according to On3 — and ""NIL Value,"" which is related to their advertising and sponsorship opportunities. These values are then combined to get their total NIL Valuation. While these student-athletes have built names for themselves through their talents, skills, and social media savvy, some top NIL earners might have had some extra help attracting deals thanks to their legacy-bearing last names. With valuations starting at $1.5 million, here's a look at the top 10 student-athletes profiting the most from NIL. These figures were accurate as of March 26, 2024. UGA junior and starting quarterback Carson Beck threw for 3,941 yards and 24 touchdowns last season, per ESPN, taking his team to victory in the Capital One Orange Bowl against Florida State University and finishing with an impressive 13-1 record. Most of Beck's NIL valuation stems from his Roster Value, which On3 estimates to be $1.1 million. Comparably, his NIL Value is estimated at $354,000 thanks to deals with EA Sports, The Players' Lounge, Associated Credit Union, Leaf Trading Cards, and Zero FG Energy. The redshirt sophomore threw for 2,834 yards and 23 touchdowns to lead the Crimson Tide to a 12-1 record, ESPN reported. Milroe signed his most recent NIL deal on March 24, 2024, with Six Star Pro Nutrition. He shared his first post for the brand on Instagram, writing in part, ""I don't want to leave any doubt on whether I'm doing enough to help the team win in 2024. That's why I've teamed up with @sixstarpronutrition to fuel my grind with world-class supplements at an affordable price."" On3 reported that some of Milroe's other sponsorships are from EA Sports, HEYDUDE Shoes, Rhoback, and Beats by Dre, where he was part of the inaugural ""Beats Elite"" class of 2023 alongside other top NIL earners like Colorado's Shedeur Sanders and Texas' Quinn Ewers, Sports Illustrated reported. LSU junior Angel Reese blew up on social media during last year's NCAA March Madness tournament, winning the highly anticipated championship game against Caitlin Clark and the University of Iowa and earning the title of most outstanding player despite racist criticisms. This year, Reese has been just as dominant. The forward was selected as SEC Player of the Year and was named to the First Team All-SEC and All-Defensive Team, all while partnering with major companies like Goldman Sachs, Topps, Beats by Dre, Tampax, Reebok, Airbnb, ZOA Energy, and Amazon, On3 reported. On March 18, she shared her ad for a Goldman Sachs investment initiative, One Million Black Women, with her 2.7 million Instagram followers, highlighting the racial wealth gap faced by Black women. ""We're asking Congress to do their part — it's time to advance the ball,"" Reese wrote. Last season, ESPN reported that sophomore quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 3,479 yards and 22 touchdowns. He helped lead his team to the College Football Playoff Semifinals, where they ultimately lost in a close game against the University of Washington. Ewers has a total On3 NIL Valuation of $1.9 million, thanks to a Roster Value of $1.2 million, and NIL deals with companies like HEYDUDE Shoes, C4Energy, EA Sports, Beats by Dre, Panini America, Ryl Tea, and Texas One Fund. In 2023, he was also named a member of 7-Eleven's Cleat Crew alongside players like Marvin Harrison Jr., Trevor Etienne, and Blake Corum.

2024 NFL mock draft: Surprising rise for 4th QB taken,"The 2024 NFL draft is heavy on offensive prospects with quarterbacks, wide receivers and offensive tackles expected to dominate the first round. The rich crop of QBs could lead some clubs to consider bold trades, but with a disproportionate number of underclassmen opting to return to college football this year, the talent drops off considerably in the middle rounds. That fact could make some of the teams currently picking in the top 10 hesitate to trade down. As such, rather than attempt to forecast trades, I stuck with the current draft order and projected the best schematic and personality fits for each club. 2024 NFL Draft prospect rankings | Top 10 QB prospects | Top 10 RB prospects | Top 10 WR prospects | Top 10 TE prospects | Top 10 OT prospects | Top 10 IOL prospects | Top 10 Edge prospects | Top 10 DT prospects | Joel Klatt's mock draft 1) Chicago Bears (from Carolina): Caleb Williams, QB, USC No surprise at the top, with the Bears selecting Williams, the most gifted quarterback of the class. The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner’s unique combination of improvisational ability and accuracy to all levels should make the Bears an immediate playoff contender. 2) Washington Commanders: Drake Maye, QB, North Carolina It might seem silly for the Commanders to trade away one former Tar Heel quarterback (Sam Howell), only to draft another one, but Maye’s upside justifies the move. Prototypically built, athletic and already well-versed in the Air Raid scheme new offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury is installing, Maye is a logical fit in Washington. 3) New England Patriots: Jayden Daniels, QB, LSU The Patriots would almost surely pounce on Williams or Maye if either were available here, but for a franchise seeking a true rebuild, Daniels’ dual-threat talents and Heisman pedigree match nicely with new offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, providing a perfect departure from the stationary pocket passers that typified the previous era. 4) Arizona Cardinals: Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Ohio State The Cardinals currently have 11 wide receivers on their roster but only one of them — second-year pro Michael Wilson — is signed into 2025. Further, the club already leads the NFL with seven of the first 104 selections of this draft. Harrison is the No. 1 target Kyler Murray and the Cardinals have been waiting for. 5) Los Angeles Chargers: Joe Alt, OT, Notre Dame I’m fascinated with the Chargers’ decision at No. 5. With longtime stars Keenan Allen (Chicago) and Mike Williams (NY Jets) playing elsewhere, nabbing a new pass-catcher for Justin Herbert like LSU’s Malik Nabers or Washington’s Rome Odunze would certainly make sense. This is Jim Harbaugh’s team now, however, and fortifying the offensive line with a decade-long starting tackle is more his style. Speaking of Harbaugh, his seemingly ceaseless public gushing over former Michigan quarterback JJ McCarthy suggests that this pick may be up for auction to a QB-needy club. 6) New York Giants: Malik Nabers, WR, LSU While the season-ending injury to starting quarterback Daniel Jones obviously played a role, Big Blue was relatively tiny when it came to production from its receivers in 2023, with Darius Slayton leading the team with just four touchdown receptions among the club’s 15. Nabers caught 14 himself last year and rewrote the LSU record books in just three seasons. 7) Tennessee Titans: JC Latham, OT, Alabama Don’t let the fact that Derrick Henry has been replaced with Tony Pollard fool you into thinking that the Titans are going to abandon the running game under new head coach Brian Callahan. This year’s tackle crop is phenomenal, which is why I expect that position group to lead all others in first round selections. Latham is as safe and versatile as it gets, warranting a top-10 pick, though with the Titans lacking a third-round selection and possessing just two picks among the first 105 overall, there is a possibility Tennessee trades out of this spot. 8) Atlanta Falcons: Dallas Turner, Edge, Alabama One of the most interesting subplots to the 2024 NFL Draft will be when the first defender comes off the board. Head coach Raheem Morris might push for Turner here given the former Alabama star’s upside and the fact that Atlanta was led in sacks (6.5) and QB hits (17) last season by 16-year NFL vet Calais Campbell, a current free agent.

"MLB predictions for 2024 season: Expert picks for World Series, playoffs 
and full standings","Play Now Men's Brackets Play Now Women's Brackets A Daily SportsLine Betting Podcast NFL Draft is coming up! Sure, two games of the 2,430 scheduled games have already been played for the 2024 Major League Baseball season, but everything else is still to come. Plus, MLB is sticking with the Opening Day branding for Thursday, so we'll continue to act as if the season hasn't actually started. Yet Opening Day it is nigh. That means we can roll out our annual predictions. As is the case every single season, there will be plenty of surprises. None of us had the Diamondbacks winning the NL pennant last season nor the Rangers taking home their first World Series title. Having unpredictable occurrences unfold during the course of our marathon season is part of the fun. If everything was as much a sure thing as the Rockies finishing last in the NL West, we wouldn't bother watching. Here at CBS Sports, our MLB staff has put together our 2024 season predictions. Here are our individual attempts to nail it down. Again, we'll get plenty right and plenty wrong. Let's do it. R.J. Anderson: Player health is the great unknown in public analysis. All we can do with that mystery is go off what we know and make our best guesses from there. As such, if you told me the Dodgers, Yankees, or some of these other teams made my World Series picks look silly by staying healthier than I expected … well, fair enough. Not that those teams (or others) have any reason to be ashamed if we do end up getting the Astros-Braves prediction. I think most everyone would agree both of those teams are at or near the top of their leagues. That it would be a rematch of the 2021 World Series is just a coincidence. Mike Axisa: Other than the two Central divisions, I think the favorites in each division are pretty clear cut, then once you get to the postseason, things are more subject to randomness. The Astros were one win away from their third straight pennant and fourth in the last five years. That team is still really good, and I think there's enough talent there to beat out the Orioles and Rangers in a short series. I see Baltimore and Texas as the best non-Astros teams in the AL. As for the NL, the Phillies are built so well for the postseason with high-end starters, a bullpen full of bat-missers, and a lineup with at least six plus hit tool players. Philadelphia as the team to beat in 2024 for me. Kate Feldman: I think the AL East and NL Central are going to be the most interesting divisions, but for very different reasons. Everyone but the Red Sox should be in the hunt for the AL East title and I wouldn't be surprised if at least two of them creep close to 100 wins. The NL Central is nowhere near as competitive but I think most of those five will be in the race late too, just closer to something like 85 wins. Maybe picking the Dodgers to win the World Series is cheating, but that's what you get when you put as much money into the lineup as they have. Dayn Perry: Explanation? I picked the team I considered to be the best in each division to win that division. Then I picked the teams I considered to be the best among the non-division winners as the wild-card entrants. In the postseason, the outcomes of which are in large measure determined by randomness, I picked teams that sounded reasonable to me at the time for reasons sufficient unto myself. That is my explanation for that which is self-explanatory. Stephen Pianovich: The title window remains yanked open in Philly by the hands of a dinger-happy lineup that still has room on their ring fingers. Can this team really sneak in through the wild card and then knock off an NL juggernaut (or two) in the playoffs again? For whatever reason, half of us believe. As do the hardworking trash collectors of western Florida. Matt Snyder: There is absolutely no doubt that the Dodgers are going to win the NL West, but I thought it would be boring to take them to win the NL. Plus, the best regular-season team hasn't come out of the NL in a full season since 2017. I've said each of the last two postseasons that the Phillies are much more...",1 month ago,1

Exploring Three Dividend Stocks In India For April 2024,"Stock Analysis Amid a backdrop of robust performance in the Indian stock market, with indices like Sensex and Nifty 50 showing consistent gains despite global uncertainties, investors are increasingly looking toward dividend stocks as a potentially stable investment avenue. In light of India's strong growth prospects and an optimistic market sentiment fueled by domestic political and economic factors, understanding what makes a good dividend stock becomes crucial for those seeking to complement their portfolios with income-generating assets. Click here to see the full list of 23 stocks from our Top Dividend Stocks screener. Let's dive into some prime choices out of from the screener. Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆ Overview: Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited, operating in India, is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of fertilizers and industrial products, with a market capitalization of approximately ₹99.64 billion. Operations: Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited generates ₹72.64 billion from fertilizer products and ₹23.10 billion from industrial products in revenue. Dividend Yield: 4% Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals has a dividend yield of 4%, ranking in the top 25% in the Indian market. Despite a less stable dividend history over the past 9 years, its dividends are supported by earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios of 31.5% and 44.2%, respectively. However, recent financial results show a significant drop in net income from INR 4.1 billion to INR 1.18 billion year-over-year for Q3, alongside declining profit margins from 12% to 8%. This financial downturn could impact future dividend reliability despite current coverage levels. Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★★☆ Overview: PTC India Limited operates in the trading of power across India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, with a market capitalization of approximately ₹67.79 billion. Operations: PTC India Limited generates revenue primarily through its power trading segment, which brought in ₹163.77 billion, and its financing business, contributing ₹7.85 billion. Dividend Yield: 3.4% PTC India's dividend sustainability is under scrutiny due to its volatile history and unreliable payments over the past decade. Recent financials show a year-over-year revenue increase to INR 34.84 billion, but net income fell to INR 794.1 million from INR 918.2 million, indicating potential pressure on future payouts despite a reasonable payout ratio of 51.8%. The company's dividends are well-covered by cash flows with a low cash payout ratio of 7.7%, suggesting some buffer against earnings volatility. However, interest payments not being well covered by earnings could pose risks to maintaining consistent dividends. Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★★☆ Overview: Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited, operating in India, is engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of fertilizers and industrial chemicals with a market capitalization of approximately ₹83.17 billion. Operations: Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited generates revenue primarily through its trading segment at ₹42.59 billion, fertilizers at ₹115.56 billion, and industrial chemicals at ₹19.59 billion. Dividend Yield: 3.5% Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) exhibits a mixed dividend profile. Despite a top quartile dividend yield of 3.52% in the Indian market, RCF’s dividends have shown volatility over the past decade, with recent earnings revealing significant declines: net income dropped to INR 112.2 million from INR 2,452 million year-over-year for Q3 2023. Nonetheless, both earnings and cash flows adequately cover dividends with payout ratios of 70.4% and 8.9%, respectively, suggesting some resilience in maintaining payouts despite financial setbacks.

"All Nifty PSE stocks gave positive returns in 2024 YTD and last 1 year; 
will this trend continue? | Mint","Stocks of public sector undertakings (PSU) have had a phenomenal run in the last one year as well as in 2024 YTD (year-to-date) with the Nifty PSE index outperforming the benchmark Nifty in both these time frames. All constituents of the Nifty PSE index were also positive in these time frames. In the last one year, the Nifty PSE index gave multibagger returns, surging over 112 percent as against an almost 27 percent jump in Nifty. Meanwhile, in 2024 YTD, the Nifty PSE index has risen over 25 percent versus a 4 percent gain in the benchmark. The recent significant increase in Indian PSU stocks, with returns as high as 300 percent within a year, is driven by a surge in government-led infrastructure investments, which has boosted demand for PSU goods and services. Additionally, expectations of political stability, particularly with a potential BJP victory in upcoming elections, have increased investor confidence in pro-business policies, further fueling optimism and investments in PSUs. Read here: Coal India vs NTPC: Which PSU stock should you pick for long-term investing?Market experts are predicting a potential selective correction for PSUs in the short term, depending on their performance in the fourth quarter. However, due to ongoing capital expenditure projects and solid growth strategies, coupled with a consistent influx of orders and the expectation of a stable government, experts believe the rally in PSU stocks will persist after the elections. ConstituentsIn the last 1 year, REC was the top performer, surging 266 percent followed by BHEL and PFC, up 257 percent and 211 percent, respectively. HAL, OIL, BEL, NALCO, IOC, NTPC, SAIL, and NHPC also gave multibagger returns up between 103 percent and 181 percent each. Meanwhile, in 2024 YTD, Oil India was the top gainer, rallying over 66 percent followed by NALCO, BHEL, HAL, and NHPC also rose over 40 percent each. Moreover, ONGC, SAIL, BPCL, IOC, BEL, GAIL, PowerGrid, HPCL, and Coal India also advanced over 20 percent each. Read here: Why Samir Arora of Helios Capital is betting on travel and PSU stocksAfter this exceptional performance by PSUs in the recent past, will the rally continue going ahead, or is there some correction in the short term? Here's what experts say: Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager at InvassetThe recent rally in the PSU index, particularly in sectors like Defense, Railways, and PSU Banks, can be attributed to several key factors. One significant driver is the concept of an ""old economy run."" During such periods, sectors that benefit from increased capital expenditure (Capex) and are sensitive to interest rate changes tend to perform well. In the context of PSU stocks, which often have strong ties to government spending and policies, this rally reflects renewed optimism around government-led investments and infrastructure development. The Defense sector, in particular, has seen increased attention and investment due to geopolitical tensions and the government's focus on enhancing national security. Similarly, the Railways sector has been bolstered by ongoing projects and modernization efforts, which have boosted investor confidence. As for PSU Banks, their rally can be linked to improving economic conditions and decreasing non-performing assets (NPAs), which have strengthened their financial outlook. Looking ahead to potential corrections, we are cautious about the midcap space, which appears relatively expensive compared to large-cap stocks. Read here: Motilal Oswal makes key changes to its model portfolio ahead of Q4 earnings seasonThe risk-to-reward ratio in midcaps might not be as favourable, especially given the current market conditions and uncertainties, including global economic trends and upcoming elections. This cautious sentiment suggests that investors may choose to focus on large-cap and potentially defensive sectors within the PSU index as a strategy to navigate potential corrections or market volatility. Sanjay Moorjani, Research Analyst, SAMCO SecuritiesThe PSU Index has witnessed an extraordinary run over the past year and a half. However, there are some pockets where the valuations are stretched. Even in the Q3FY24 results, fundamentals were far behind the market valuations. However, the government's persistent prioritisation of power development, indigenous production for defence, railways and affordable housing projects has upheld investor enthusiasm in this sector. The expectations of the NDA government coming back to power might further lead to a rally in PSU stocks. Amongst the PSU stocks, we like HAL, Cochin Shipyard, NTPC and Railtel.

Most Undervalued Stocks in India 2024 â Forbes Advisor INDIA,"Updated: Apr 16, 2024, 3:31pm Equities that we think could have done much better than what they are doing in real-time at the stock markets are worth consideration. There are brokerage companies that have invested in such stocks and assumed a dominant position in the market, similar to individuals who have invested at the right time in undervalued stocks that have shone bright in due course. The trick is in identifying the right company that has the potential to grow and has not been identified yet by the investors. There are many factors impacting the price of a share such as management, policies, business module, and geopolitical situation. Upon careful consideration, one can speculate if the company is going to perform and will the shares deliver. Here’s a list of the most undervalued stocks in India in 2023.

Understanding these factors is essential for investors when assessing the potential value of a stock. Here are some of the key factors on which the value of stocks depends: Profits: The financial performance of a company is a fundamental factor. Investors often look at metrics such as earnings per share (EPS), revenue growth, and profitability to assess the company’s financial health. Dividends: Dividend payments to shareholders can be an attractive aspect of a stock’s value. Companies that consistently pay dividends or have a history of increasing dividend payouts may be seen as more valuable to income-focused investors. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio compares a company’s stock price to its earnings per share. A lower P/E ratio may indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a higher ratio may suggest it’s overvalued. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio: The P/B ratio compares a company’s stock price to its book value per share, which is the value of its assets minus liabilities. A P/B ratio below 1 can suggest an undervalued stock. Growth Prospects: Investors often assess a company’s growth potential, including its expansion plans, new product offerings, and market share. Companies with strong growth prospects may be considered more valuable. Market Sentiment: Investor sentiment can impact stock prices. Positive news, favorable analyst reports, or overall optimism about the market can drive prices up, while negative sentiment can lead to declines. Macroeconomic factors: Economic conditions, such as inflation rates, interest rates, and overall economic health, can influence stock prices. A strong economy may boost stock values, while a recession can depress them. Industry and sector trends: The performance of a stock can be influenced by broader industry and sector trends. Companies operating in growing industries may see increased stock value. Competitive position: A company’s competitive position within its industry is crucial. Strong market share, brand recognition, and a competitive advantage can make a company’s stock more valuable. Management quality: The competence and integrity of a company’s management team can impact stock value. Skilled and shareholder-friendly management can add value. Regulatory environment: Changes in regulations, tax policies, or government actions can affect a company’s profitability and stock value. Global and geopolitical events: Events on a global scale, such as geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions, or natural disasters, can influence stock prices, especially for companies with global operations. Currency exchange rates: For multinational companies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact earnings and stock prices. Technological advancements: Technological innovations or disruptions within an industry can affect a company’s competitiveness and stock value. Investor behavior: Investor behavior, including buying and selling decisions, can create short-term price fluctuations. Investing in undervalued stocks in India, or anywhere else, requires a systematic approach and thorough research. Before investing, gain a good understanding of how the stock market works, the principles of value investing, and the factors that determine a stock’s value. Books, courses, and online resources can be helpful for learning. This research work will help you...",1 week ago,1

The Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has faced selling pressure from the resistance zone of 22560 – 22625. Until this zone is not taken out decisively, we can expect the consolidation to continue.
On the downside, crucial support is now placed at 22240 – 22200 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 21777 – 22626 is placed.
As far as the Bank Nifty is concerned the recovery from the previous day’s lows was short-lived and lacked follow-up buying interest. The divergence on the momentum indicator also did not support the upmove. This could lead to some consolidation in the near term. On the downside, 47500 is the crucial level to watch out for.

Indian rupee ended flat at 83.34 per dollar on Friday against Thursday's close of 83.32.
 Indian markets snapped 5-day winning run with Nifty breaking22,400 in the volatile session on April 26.
At close, the Sensex was down 609.28 points or 0.82 percent at 73,730.16, and the Nifty was down 150.30 points or 0.67 percent at 22,420. About 1710 shares advanced, 1521 shares declined, and 106 shares unchanged.
Top losers on the Nifty were Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Nestle India, IndusInd Bank, M&M, while gainers were Tech Mahindra, Divis Labs, LTIMindtree, Bajaj Auto, BPCL.
Among sectors, except auto, bank, capital goods, all other indices ended in the green, with oil & gas, healthcare, realty, media up 0.3-1 percent.
BSE midcap index up 0.8 percent and smallcap index up 0.3 percent.


Oil prices rose on Friday, on track to end higher this week after two straight weeks of losses, after a top U.S. official expressed optimism over economic growth and as supply concerns lingered due to conflicts in the Middle East.
Brent crude futures gained 19 cents, or 0.2%, to $89.20 a barrel at 0927 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose by 25 cents, or 0.3%, to $83.82 a barrel.

"Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, 7 stocks to buy or 
sell","Stock market today: Despite a gap-down opening, the Indian stock market witnessed a strong bounceback and finished higher for the fifth day in a row on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index gained 167 points and closed at a 22,570 level, the BSE Sensex surged 486 points and ended at the 74,399 mark while the Bank Nifty index finished 305 points higher at the 48,494 level. In the broad market, the Small-cap index outperformed the Nifty 50 index, even as the advance-decline ratio stayed firm at 1.19:1. Trade setup or FridaySpeaking on the outlook for the Nifty 50 index, Neeraj Sharma, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta said, ""Bulls kept their grip on Dalal Street on F&O expiry day, continuing the rise for the fifth consecutive session in a row. India's VIX, rose by 4.42% to 10.73, expectation of volatility in the short term. Volatility increased as traders rolled over holdings in the F&O segment from April to May series. Finally, the Nifty closed the day on a positive note at 22,570. Technically, the index has crossed a bearish gap of roughly 22,500 levels and maintained above it. Thus, the index will likely continue its upward trend and may attempt to break its all-time high of 22,776. The Nifty's short-term support levels are 22,500 and 22,300, with resistance around 22,780 and 23,000. Nifty small-cap index has registered a record high, while mid-cap index is still 1% away from its previous high."" Also Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today — April 26 On the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, ""The knee-jerk reaction was bought into and the Bank Nifty witnessed a smart recovery to close with gains of nearly 300 points post opening down almost 400 points. Going ahead we expect the momentum to continue and minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity. On the upside, the next hurdle is placed at 49,000. Longs should be held with a trailing stop loss at 48,200 which is the 20-hour moving average."" Unveiling intraday trading strategy for the Indian stock market today, Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One said, ""The recent rally, particularly evident since Friday, has been characterized by broader market participation and a tendency for buying into dips. This trend is anticipated to persist, with prices likely to retest previous high levels in upcoming sessions. Traders are advised to maintain a positive outlook and capitalize on buying opportunities during market dips. Furthermore, the strong performance of mid and small-cap stocks warrants continued focus for potential outperformance. However, selectivity is crucial at this stage, as the low-hanging fruits have already gone.""

"Day trading stocks to buy: ITC to Tata Power â Anand Rathi expert 
recommends three shares to buy today â 26th April | Mint","Day trading stocks to buy today: After a gap-down opening, the Indian stock market witnessed a strong pullback and ended higher for the fifth day in a row on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index gained 167 points and closed at a 22,570 level, the BSE Sensex surged 486 points and ended at the 74,399 mark while the Bank Nifty index finished 305 points higher at the 48,494 level. In the broad market, the Small-cap index outperformed the Nifty 50 index, even as the advance-decline ratio stayed firm at 1.19:1. Anand Rathi's stock picksGanesh Dongre, Senior Manager — Technical Research at Anand Rathi believes that the Nifty 50 index is close to its resistance level of 22,500 to 22,600 zone. The Anand Rathi expert went on to add that on breaching this hurdle, the 50-stock index may touch 22,800 to 22,900 levels in the short term. On day trading stocks for today, Ganesh Dongre of Anand Rathi recommended three shares to buy today — ITC, BEL, and Tata Power. Stock market todayOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Ganesh Dongre said, ""On the Nifty front, we are now closed near to the resistance level of 22500–22600 zone, which may keep the movement sideways for the Nifty in the upcoming days. Now the next resistance for the Nifty spot will be 22800–22900. As per today's chart pattern, we have seen the gap-down opening but then continuing its bullish trend pattern for the rest of the day and closing in positive territory. So, on the Nifty front, until the time Nifty holds above its support level of 22400–22450, the 50-stock index will remain in a bullish trend until the resistance level of 22800 to 22900."" ""On the Bank Nifty front, we have seen a gap-up-down opening on Thursday, but it continues its bullish trend for the rest of the day, so for the upcoming trading session, Bank Nifty support will be at the 48,000 level and resistance will be at the 49m000 level,"" Dongre added. Shares to buy today1] ITC: Buy at ₹437, target ₹452, stop loss ₹428. We have seen a major support in ITC share price around 428 rupees. So, at the current juncture, ITC share price has again seen a reversal price action formation at the ₹437 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of ₹452, so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of ₹428 for the target price of ₹452 ₹in the near term. 2] BEL: Buy at ₹237, target ₹252, stop loss ₹230. In the short-term trend, BEL share price has seen a bullish reversal pattern, technically retrenchment could be possible till ₹252. So, holding the support level of ₹230 this stock can bounce toward ₹252 in level the short term. Hence, the trader can go long with a stop loss of ₹230 for the target price of ₹252. 3] Tata Power: Buy at ₹430, target ₹445, stop loss ₹418. We have seen a fresh breakout in Tata Power shares around 430 rupees. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the ₹430 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of ₹445. Hence, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of ₹418 for the target price of ₹445 in the upcoming weeks.

"Stocks to Watch: Tech Mahindra, HCLTech, Indigo, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, 
Vedanta | Mint","Tech Mahindra: On Thursday, April 25, Tech Mahindra reported a 41% drop in its consolidated net profit in Q4FY24, which stood at ₹661 crore. The company's revenue from operations also fell 6.2% to ₹12,871.3 crore in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year. In comparison to ₹1,117.7 crore in the corresponding period last year, Tech Mahindra's net profit for the March quarter plummeted by 41%. The company's revenue also experienced a 6.3% decrease in the fourth quarter, amounting to ₹13,718 crore compared to the same period last year. For FY24, the consolidated net profit decreased 51.2% YoY, amounting to ₹2,358 crore. The company's revenue for FY24 was ₹51,996 crore, marking a 2.4% decline from the previous fiscal year. The board of the company proposed a final dividend of 560%, which equates to ₹28 per equity share with a face value of ₹5 each. IndiGo: IndiGo has made its foray into the long-haul market by placing an order for 30 wide-body aircraft. The order comprises 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, which will be equipped with Rolls Royce’s Trent XWB engines. This new order marks IndiGo's entry into the wide-body aircraft category, a segment previously occupied by Air India and Vistara. At present, IndiGo operates a fleet of over 360 aircraft. In June 2023, the airline placed a substantial order for 500 aircraft with Airbus at the Paris air show. As a result, the airline's total order book now stands at around 1,000 aircraft, including Airbus 320, 321, and 321XLRs. As reported by Mint in November, IndiGo has been in discussions with aircraft manufacturers to purchase up to 20 wide-body aircraft as part of its strategy to expand its international operations. HCL Technologies: The company is anticipated to announce its Q4 results for the fiscal year 2023-24 on April 26, with expectations of relatively unchanged revenues on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. The company's products and platforms (P&P) business is predicted to negatively impact its earnings, despite the potential cushioning effect of the services business. The decline in the profitable P&P segment is also likely to affect HCLTech's net profit for the fourth quarter. According to the average forecast of seven brokerages, HCL Technologies is projected to report a net profit of ₹4,054.71 crore in Q4 FY24, marking a 6.78% decrease QoQ. The company's revenues are expected to slightly increase by 0.37% QoQ, reaching ₹28,552.64 crore. However, its EBIT margin is predicted to drop by 152 basis points (bps) QoQ, settling at 18.18%. Tata Steel: The company announced on Thursday that it has successfully negotiated a formal agreement with UK trade unions that clears the path for a £1.25 billion electric arc furnace project at the company's Port Talbot plant, which will replace two outdated blast furnaces. Securing the support of the trade unions was a critical step before the steelmaker could move forward with its plans. Reports from British media suggest that this plan could result in as many as 2,800 job losses. This agreement was reached after Tata Steel turned down a union proposal to keep one of the blast furnaces operational at the plant in an effort to preserve jobs, reported The Guardian. The company stated in a press release on Thursday that maintaining one blast furnace during the transition would have led to at least £1.6 billion in extra costs, posed operational and safety risks, and jeopardized the future stability of the business. IndusInd Bank: On Thursday, April 25, IndusInd Bank announced a 15% increase in net profit to ₹2,349 crore for the January-March quarter of the 2023-24 fiscal year. This figure surpassed the analysts' predictions, which had anticipated a profit of ₹2,322.7 crore. The bank's net interest income (NII) rose by 13.9% to ₹5,376.4 crore, up from ₹4,669.5 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. IndusInd Bank's performance was boosted by an 18% increase in net loans, which outstripped the 14% growth in deposits. The gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio was reported at 1.92%, a decrease from the 1.98% recorded in the same quarter last year. Similarly, the net NPA ratio improved to 0.57%, down from 0.59% on a year-on-year basis. Operating expenses for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, rose by 24% to ₹3,803 crore, compared to ₹3,066 crore for the same quarter of the previous year. Additionally, IndusInd Bank declared a dividend of ₹16.50 per equity share with a face value of ₹10.

"Sensex Today Live Updates: Sensex down 500pts, Nifty at 22,420; Consumer 
Durables, IT gain, FS, Bank down | Mint","Market Close Highlights : European stocks gained along with US equity futures following blockbuster earnings from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. The yen weakened to a 34-year low after the Bank of Japan kept its key interest rate unchanged. The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.5%, heading for its first weekly advance in four, with the technology sector among the leading gainers. Miners rose as copper hit $10,000 a ton for the first time in two years, though Anglo American Plc underperformed after rejecting BHP Group’s $39 billion takeover proposal. Contracts for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 signaled the underlying gauges are set to rebound from Thursday’s losses. That’s after Alphabet crushed sales estimates and announced a dividend. Fellow megacap Microsoft also beat forecasts, lifted by corporate demand for the software maker’s cloud and artificial-intelligence offerings. About 79% of S&P 500 firms that have reported so far have beaten analysts’ earnings estimates, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists. Still, stock price reactions have been underwhelming, with better-than-expected results seeing below average upside, while those missing estimates are being penalized by more than usual, the strategists wrote. While earnings continue to roll in, the focus Friday will also be on US data, with the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation of particular interest. Treasury yields dipped following yesterday’s losses when economic data pushed back expectations for policy easing. A gauge of the dollar was steady. The strong earnings news from the US supported gains on Friday for some of Asia’s tech titans, including Samsung Electronics Co., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Equity benchmarks in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China all advanced. In Japan, the yen reversed initial gains to fall to 156 per dollar, the lowest level since 1990, following the BOJ decision. The central bank Friday kept the range for its benchmark rate between 0% and 0.1%, according to a statement, as widely expected by economists. US core PCE price index data published Thursday advanced at a faster-than-expected 3.7% clip. The print combined with a US gross domestic product data that trailed all forecasts to rekindle the specter of stagflation. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the core PCE deflator, is due later Friday. Elsewhere, gold edged higher Friday even as the precious metal headed for a weekly loss. West Texas Intermediate rose to the highest level in more than a week, on pace for a weekly advance.

"Indian stock market likely to see profit booking after Lok Sabha elections 
2024, says Bernstein | Mint","      The Indian stock market is likely to see profit-booking after the Lok Sabha elections and the results will be the trigger, said brokerage firm Bernstein. It believes a pre-election euphoria is building up, where the previously set expectations of continuity of power are further augmented by the ruling party coalition possibly winning over 400 seats.
   “With sky-high expectations having set in, a number near to the 2019 value might trigger a short-term negative reaction, but we believe a profit-booking post-elections is coming anyway, and the election results will only serve as a trigger point for the inevitable,"" said Bernstein analysts Venugopal Garre and Nikhil Arela in a report.
 Also Read: Bajaj Finance share price correction provides attractive entry point, says Emkay Global; sees 23% upside
   Eventually, the macro story will take over, and as it stays healthy, the analysts expect modest downsides. They expect manufacturing and capex stories will remain a key theme irrespective of the seats garnered.
   The brokerage house noted that some polls project as high as 411 seats of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and given the recent performance in state elections and the results of almost all major opinion polls, 390-400 seats have become the new base case.
   “A correction is inevitable, and markets that are simply looking for a reason to fall may overreact to a sentiment that may not mean much rationally. On the face of it, 300 seats will still mean the ruling party getting the absolute majority, and a construct similar to 2019, which is, in fact, a continuity of power as well as a continuity of extent of power. Still, it will be seen as a “below consensus"" result, and a reaction cannot be denied,"" the analysts said.

   This can eventually start the end of the current market frenzy, which has lasted for a full year, they added.
   The domestic stock market started the year 2024 at record valuations, particularly in the small and mid-cap space. After continuing the run in January, February and March seemed to return some normalcy to the valuations, but this month has picked up again, with small caps up 4% and mid-caps 2%.
   However, Bernstein believes going ahead, the focus on manufacturing, which has been very high in the recent manifesto, is expected to continue. This is also an area targeted to improve the unemployment situation, so getting fewer than expected seats may only embolden the government further to double down on this vision.

10 Best Stocks Under Rs 10 in India in 2024,,1 week ago,1
"9 Nifty Metal stocks including Vedanta, NALCO, SAIL gained 20%-50% in 2024; 
check full list | Mint","Metal stocks have emerged as a popular choice on Dalal Street in 2024, driven by the sustained increase in base metal prices, optimistic forecasts from analysts regarding metal companies, and robust business updates in the fourth quarter. These factors collectively have boosted investor confidence. In the previous trading session, the Nifty Metal index jumped 2.9% to hit a new all-time high of 9,158 points. This increase has contributed to a total return of 14.60% for the calendar year 2024. Remarkably, this marks the fifth consecutive year of growth for Indian metal stocks. This year, 9 out of 15 constituents of the Nifty Metal index have shown impressive returns, ranging between 20% and 50%, with Vedanta leading as the top gainer. Starting the year at ₹258.55 per share, Vedanta's stock has surged to the current price of ₹383.45, marking a return of nearly 50%. Currently, the stock is trading at its 24-month high. Recently, global brokerage firm CLSA upgraded Vedanta's stock by two notches from ""underperform"" to ""buy,"" anticipating the company to benefit from the ongoing surge in metal prices. Also Read: Vedanta targets $7.5 bn in earnings in 2 years, deleverage group by $3 bn CLSA also revised its target price for the stock to ₹390, making it the second-highest target after Nuvama's ₹394. Similarly, shares of NALCO have been on a remarkable journey, surging by 23.24% this month alone. The surge follows NALCO's report earlier this month, announcing its highest-ever metal sales, cast metal production, and bauxite excavation in fiscal 2024. For the calendar year 2024, NALCO's stock witnessed a 43% increase. SAIL, another PSU firm, has seen robust performance in 2024, driven by record annual production and sales in FY24. The increasing demand for steel amid a global manufacturing recovery and ongoing capital expenditure growth in India has further bolstered stock prices. So far this year, SAIL's stock has surged from ₹123.65 per share to ₹164.65, yielding a return of 33.15%. Also Read: Hindustan Zinc needs strong prices to show its mettle in FY25 Hindustan Zinc shares have surged by 48% between April 1 and April 12 amid a strong rise in zinc and lead prices. This surge is expected to improve company margins, as the relatively stable production costs juxtaposed with increased selling prices result in higher profits per unit sold. Moreover, the sharp rally in silver prices to multi-year highs has further boosted the company's shares. So far this year, the stock has yielded a return of nearly 29%. Other stocks, such as MOIL, Jindal Steel, Tata Steel, NMDC, and Coal India, have all yielded returns in the range of 20% to 25%. Base metals boomBase metals like Copper, Aluminum, Zinc, Lead, and Nickel resumed their upward trajectory this week after a brief pause. This resurgence was fueled by expectations of rate cuts from the Fed, increased business activity in major economies such as India, and growing concerns about the supply shortage. In India, business activity surged at its fastest pace in 14 years, with the flash composite purchasing managers index for April reaching 62.2, surpassing economists' expectations. Also Read: Metals: Rebound in global manufacturing activity pushes prices high Similarly, Eurozone private sector activity experienced significant growth in March, the most in 11 months, with Germany's Composite PMI rising to 50.5 from 47.7 in the previous month, surpassing market expectations. Japan and Australia also reported growth in business activity in the previous month. The ban on metals from Russia, a major global supplier of nickel and aluminum, by Washington and London has raised concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains. Conversely, some of the world's largest energy trading companies are re-entering the metals market after facing challenges in the past. Vitol Group, Gunvor Group, and Mercuria Energy Group are expanding their metals teams, aiming to invest capital generated from record profits, Bloomberg reported. On the supply side, Cobre Panama, one of the world’s largest open-pit copper mines, was forced to stop operations in December, leading to a deficit in the global supply of copper concentrate this year.

"Renewable energy stocks jump up to 500% in 1 year; what's fuelling this 
rise? What should you buy from the sector? | Mint","Some renewable energy stocks, such as Inox Wind Energy and KPI Green Energy, have surged 450-500 per cent over the last year. Some others, such as SRM Energy, SJVN, JP Power Ventures and Adani Power have jumped 200-350 per cent in the same period. There are over 15 stocks in the renewable energy space that have jumped more than 100 per cent in the last one year. What explains this steep rise in renewable energy stocks?Renewable energy as a sector is witnessing strong tailwinds. As the world is moving full throttle towards the goal of zero carbon emissions, so is India. India has set an ambitious goal of having 50 per cent of its electricity generation from non-fossil fuels by 2030. By 2070, India wants to achieve the goal of 'net zero' and for that, it has drawn up plans to aggressively focus on clean energy. Strong government support for decarbonisation strategy goals is an important factor that has raised investors' interest in the sector. Sehul Bhatt, Director– Research, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics, pointed out that the government has provided direct capital subsidies (especially for solar rooftop, storage and hydro), created dedicated nodal agencies (such as Solar Energy Corporation of India, Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, Power Finance Corporation, REC and International Solar Alliance) and added solar supply chain to Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The government has also taken proactive measures to solve the challenges the sector is facing. The government’s continuous monitoring of the sector and measures taken to establish the required infrastructure (40 GW solar park initiative, 500 GW RE integration, Green Energy Corridor) indicate the criticality of the sector, Bhatt said. A long-term growth story?Experts are positive about the renewable energy space for the long term. Renewable energy is expected to remain a focus of the new government after the Lok Sabha election. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in its Lok Sabha election manifesto 'Sankalp Patra,' emphasized that India will achieve energy independence by 2047 and the government will harness India's renewable energy potential. ""We will achieve energy independence for Bharat by 2047 and reduce petroleum imports through a mix of electric mobility, network of charging stations, renewable energy production and improving energy efficiency,"" the BJP manifesto says. ""We will harness Bharat’s renewable energy potential, targeting 500 GW of renewable energy through the establishment of mega solar parks, wind parks and the Green Energy Corridor project among others."" Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities believes the policy continuity indicated in the BJP manifesto will bring in greater clarity, scale and confidence among the business community and investors – both global and local. ""We may witness greater aggression in execution and new reform measures from the new government. Although the results of these measures may time to fructify, the markets tend to discount the triggers in advance. The GDP and in turn corporate profitability may grow at a faster pace and the valuations also may nudge up a bit reflecting greater visibility of sales and profitability growth,"" said Jasani. According to Bhatt of CRISIL, by 2030, India will likely have a non-fossil installed base of 510-520 GW, forming 60-65 per cent of total power capacity and 45-47 per cent of electricity generation. That will be 2.5-3 times in terms of installed capacity base and 2.5-3 times the share in electricity generation from the current level. Renewable energy stocks to buyThe outlook for the renewable energy sector appears attractive from a medium to long-term perspective due to strong government initiatives such as favourable incentives, cheaper financing options and ease of setting up of business in the sector. Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox underscored that robust power demand from end-users which is expected to grow at 8 per cent per annum in the near future and increasing awareness about the environment are additional tailwinds for the sector. ""With an expected addition of about 40 GW cumulatively in the renewable sector over the next two years, we sense that companies across the value chain should benefit from this trend. We remain positive on SJVN and Sterling & Wilson Solar and expect about 20 per cent returns from a 12-month timeframe,"" said Chowdhury. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst, Swastika Investmart is of the view that companies specialising in solar power, wind energy, and energy storage solutions have benefited from favourable government policies and increasing environmental awareness. “Long-term investors can take positions in stocks like Tata Power, Waaree Renewables, Reliance, etc.,"" said Gour.

"Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, 7 stocks to buy or 
sell on Thursday â April 25 | Mint","Stock market today: Following strong global cues, the Indian stock market finished higher for the fourth day in a row on Wednesday. The Nifty 50 index gained 34 points and closed at the 22,402 level, the BSE Sensex surged 114 points and ended at the 73,852 mark whereas the Bank Nifty index went up 218 points and closed at the 48,189 level. Cash market volumes on the NSE were lower compared to the previous day, totaling ₹1.03 lakh crore. The broad market indices outperformed the Nifty 50 index, even as the advance-decline ratio stayed firm at 1.63:1. Trade setup for ThursdayOn the outlook for Nifty today, Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, ""The Nifty 50 index opened on a positive note on Wednesday and consolidated to close in the green up 34 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty 50 index has been trading around the 22,400 mark, which coincides with the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous fall from 22,776 to 21,777 and also the lower end of the gap area formed on the 15th April. A brief consolidation is likely to continue considering the sharp run-up. The hourly momentum indicator has a negative crossover which also suggests some consolidation before it starts a new cycle on the upside. On the upside we expect the Nifty 50 index to target levels of 22,560 from a short-term perspective."" Also Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today — April 25 On the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said, ""The Bank Nifty saw a sideways trading session following a positive start, holding firm around the support zone of 48000-47800. Immediate resistance is noted at 48500, and a decisive breakthrough could signal further upside towards 49500/50000 levels. With the overall sentiment remaining bullish, any pullbacks towards the support zone should be viewed as buying opportunities."" On triggers that may dictate the Indian stock market today, Motilal Oswal Private Wealth report said, ""Over the last five years, India's capital markets have witnessed vibrant participation from domestic retail savers, with Demat accounts surging to 151 mn in Mar'24 from 36 mn in Mar'19. India Inc. has raised USD 92.9 bn through primary markets during this period. Expectations of political continuity augur well for market sentiment. Corporate earnings growth may witness moderation relative to the pace witnessed over the last few years but is expected to remain steady given the robust health of India Inc.'s balance sheets and the ongoing capex cycle. BFSI, Infrastructure, and manufacturing are likely to be the key focus sectors going forward.""

The rupee inched up 1 paisa to close at 83.32 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday as the support from positive domestic equities was negated by continued selling pressure from foreign funds.

Rising for the fifth straight session, equity benchmark Sensex rallied nearly 500 points to reclaim the 74,000 mark while the Nifty closed above the 22,550 level on Thursday, driven by heavy buying in banking, financial and metal stocks.

It also formed long bullish candle on daily charts, which supports further uptrend from the current levels. For the trend following traders now 22475/74100 would act as a trend decider level.

However, below 22475/74100 the sentiment could change. Below which, the market could retest the level of 22350-22300/73800-73600.

"Day trading stocks to buy: Anand Rathi expert recommends IndusInd Bank, 
Federal Bank and GAIL to buy today â April 25 | Mint","Day trading stocks to buy today: Following weakness in the Asian stock market, the Indian stock market opened lower on Thursday, ending its four-day winning streak that started last Friday. The Nifty 50 index is down by nearly 60 points, the BSE Sensex is down by over 200 points whereas the Bank Nifty today is down by nearly 170 points. Asian equity markets dropped after Meta Platforms Inc.’s disappointing outlook raised concern about whether the industry that has powered the bull market in equities has run too far. Equity benchmarks slid in Hong Kong, Japan, and mainland China, while contracts for US stocks also pointed to declines. Australian financial markets are shut for a holiday. The yen extended declines after weakening beyond 155 per dollar for the first time in more than three decades on Wednesday, heightening the chances of intervention ahead of the Bank of Japan’s decision meeting on Friday. Anand Rathi's stock picksGanesh Dongre, Senior Manager — Technical Research at Anand Rathi believes that the Indian stock market bias will remain positive till the Nifty 50 index sustains above the 22,200 to 22,250 mark. The Anand Rathi expert maintained that the market mood turns further bullish once the 50-stock index breaches above the resistance placed at 22,550 to 22,600 levels. On day trading stocks for today, Ganesh Dongre of Anand Rathi recommended these three shares to buy today — IndusInd Bank, Federal Bank, and GAIL. Stock market todaySpeaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Ganesh Dongre said, ""On the Nifty front, we are now on the support level of 22,200 to 22,250 zone, which will keep the movement upward for the Nifty in the upcoming sessions. Now the resistance for the Nifty spot will be 22500–22600. As per the latest chart pattern, we have seen the gap up opening and then continuing its bullish trend pattern for the rest of the day and closing in positive territory. So, on the Nifty front, until the time holds above its support level of 22200–22250, the Nifty will remain in a bullish trend until the resistance level of 22550 to 22600."" ""At this juncture, on the other hand, on the Bank Nifty front, we have again seen a gap-up opening today, and continue its bullish trend for the rest of the day, so for the upcoming trading session, Bank Nifty support will be at the 47400 to 47500 level and resistance will be at the 48,500 level,"" said Dongre. Shares to buy todayIndusInd Bank: Buy at ₹1675, target ₹1730, stop loss ₹1630We have seen a major support in this stock around 1630 rupees. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the ₹1630 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of 1730 rupees, so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of ₹1630 for the target price of ₹1730 in the near term. Federal Bank: Buy at ₹154, target ₹162, stop loss ₹149In the short-term trend, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern, technically retrenchment could be possible till ₹162 so, holding the support level of ₹149 this stock can bounce toward ₹162 in the short term, so the trader can go long with a stop loss of ₹149 for the target price of ₹162. GAIL: Buy at ₹207, target ₹217, stop loss ₹200We have seen a fresh breakout in this stock around 200 rupees. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the ₹200 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of ₹217, so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of ₹200 for the target price of ₹217 in the near term.

"Stock market today: Day trading guide for Nifty 50 to Sensex, six stocks to 
buy or sell today â April 24 | Mint","Day trading guide for today: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty 50 rose for the third straight day in the previous session following gains in telecom, tech and consumer durable shares amid a strong trend in the global markets. Volatility index plunged to within a margin of its record closing low amid fading worries over a major escalation in the Middle East conflict. The fear gauge India VIX which suggests how much the Nifty 50 index is likely to change in the next 30 days, plunged 20 per cent to reach near the level of 10. A low India VIX indicates that the market is stable and predictable. The VIX dropped today in its steepest one-day decline since May 23, 2019, and settled just a few points near its record closing low from July 28, 2023. Sensex settled with a slim gain of 90 points, or 0.12 per cent, at 73,738.45 as gains in shares of heavyweights including Bharti Airtel, ITC, Infosys and SBI were offset by losses in shares of Reliance Industries. Also Read: India needs 8-10% growth over next decade to reap demographic dividend: RBI Nifty 50 closed the day at 22,368, up 32 points, or 0.14 per cent. The two indices gained about 1.7 per cent each over the past three sessions. Mid and smallcap indices outperformed the benchmarks. The BSE Midcap index rose 0.52 per cent and the smallcap index jumped 1.05 per cent. Commenting on markets, Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, ""The domestic market exhibited range-bound performance, tracking positive global cues with sustained outperformance of the broader market. While tensions between Iran and Israel were perceived to have limited escalation, the uptick in crude prices suggests investors’ reassessing the risks.'' Day trading guide for the stock market todayOn the outlook for Nifty today, Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking Ltd said, ‘’We may see a pause in the index after the recent surge but the tone is likely to remain positive citing a sharp dip in the volatility index i.e. India VIX. Meanwhile, traders should continue with stock-specific approach and utilize corrections to accumulate quality names.'' Also Read: Gold hits over two-week low despite touching record highs in 2024; What's hurting the yellow metal's appeal? Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd said, “Markets pared most of their early gains due to profit-taking in late trades. The good news to cheer was that India VIX has cooled by another 18.90 per cent to 10.30 levels. Volatility to take the centre stage as F&O contracts for April expire this Thursday and traders would want to rollover their positions to next expiry day.'' On the technical front, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities said, ""The Nifty remained sideways throughout the session as it failed to provide any directional breakout. However, the overall trend remains positive as the index closed above the critical moving average. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bullish crossover with a reading below 60.'' ‘’On the higher end, the range of 22,350-22,400 is likely to act as a resistance zone; a decisive breakout above 22,400 might trigger a rally in the market. On the lower end, support is positioned at 22,250; a breach below this level might weaken the bullish sentiment."" Also Read: Tata Consumer Products Q4 Results: Net profit drops 22% to ₹267 crore, revenue down 8.5% YoY; dividend declared On the outlook for Bank Nifty, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said, ""The Bank Nifty index experienced a sideways trading session following a positive opening, with bears asserting dominance at higher levels. Despite this, the overall sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that dips should be seen as buying opportunities.'' ‘’Strong support is observed around the 47,800-47,700 zone. However, the immediate hurdle lies at 48,200-48,500. A breakthrough above this resistance could pave the way for the index to achieve fresh all-time high levels,"" added Shah. Global CuesWall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings and advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.

"Market Close Highlights : Sensex ends up 480pts, Nifty at 22,570; All 
sectoral indices barring Consumer & Realty gain | Mint","Market Close Highlights : World stocks snapped a three-day winning streak on Thursday as disappointing forecasts from Facebook and Instagram parent Meta hammered tech, while the yen's drop through 155 per dollar for the first time since 1990 kept FX traders on intervention alert. Both U.S. Q1 GDP data and more 'Big Tech' earnings were scheduled for later in the day but for now it was Meta's 15% after-hours price slump that was souring the mood. Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei slid 2% in Asian trading and European tech stocks were down 0.8% in early dealing as traders did pretty much the opposite to the previous day after Tesla had promised new models by early next year. In an earnings-packed week, tech bellwethers are in the spotlight, with Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel also due to report on Thursday. European earnings and M&A deals were flooding in too. London's FTSE 100 hit another record high as UK-listed miner Anglo American surged 11% on a buyout offer from Aussie rival BHP, while Deutsche Bank slipped and BNP Paribas edged up after the euro zone's biggest lenders posted upbeat first-quarter profits. Beyond corporate earnings, investor focus will be on the first quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) data due out later. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have pushed back and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with markets now pricing in roughly a 70% chance of a first reduction in September. They are not even fully convinced there will now be another one this year, having expected around six cuts at the start of the year. The shifting expectations of U.S. rates have lifted Treasury yields and the dollar, casting a shadow on the currency market. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was little changed at 105.75. In the commodity markets, U.S. crude rose 0.1% to $82.89 per barrel and Brent was at $88.13, up 0.12% on the day. Gold, which hit a record high earlier this month, inched up to $2,326 an ounce. Sensex Today Live : Indian benchmark indices surged for the fifth straight session on Thursday, following a raft of positive earnings reports from companies, while shaking of the muted sentiment flowing from Asian and global peers.Sensex, which had opened lower at 73,572.34, remained muted for most of the day, even touching a low of 73,556.15.

"Can Maruti Suzuki India Q4 results justify recent stock rally? Here's 
earnings preview","Feedback
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL), whose shares are up 26 per cent in 2024 so far, will be announcing its March quarter results today. The largest carmaker is seen reporting 50-65 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit for the March quarter on 20-22 per cent rise in net sales, on favourable product mix, increase in average selling price (ASP) and healthy volumes. Margin is seen expanding by 150-350 basis points YoY on commodity tailwinds  and favourable forex, analysts said.
Prabhudas Lilladher expects Maruti Suzuki India to log 48 per cent YoY surge in net profit at Rs 3,884 crore from Rs 2,623.60 crore YoY. It sees sales for Maruti Suzuki rising 21.2 per cent YoY to Rs 38,838 crore from Rs 32,048 crore. Ebitda is seen rising 47 per cent YoY to Rs 4,926 crore while Ebitda margin is seen expanding 223 basis points to 12.7 per cent.
""We expect MSIL's revenue to grow by 21.2 per cent YoY/16 per cent QoQ, driven by volume expansion of 13.4 per cent YoY/16.5 per cent QoQ. The mix of UVs increased from 26 per cent in Q4FY23 to 36.7 per cent in Q4FY24, which should aid in Ebitda margin expansion. Consequently, PAT could grow by 48 per cent YoY/24.1 per cent QoQ,"" PL said.
Nomura India sees Maruti Suzuki India's profit at Rs 4,265 crore, up 63 per cent YoY. It sees sales for MSIL rising 21 per cent YoY to Rs 38,693 crore. This brokerage sees margin at 13.9 per cent, up 347 basis points.
""We expect revenue growth of 21 per cent YoY as volumes are up 13 per cent YoY followed by favourable mix and price hike. Ebitda margins increase by 220 basis points QoQ to 13.9 per cent on operating leverage, benign commodity and lower discounts,"" it said.
Kotak Institutional Equities expect revenues to increase 20 per cent YoY led by 13 per cent YoY increase in volumes and 6 per cent YoY  increase in ASPs due to price increases and a richer product mix (higher mix of SUV segment).
""We expect EBITDA margin to improve by 170 bps qoq to 13.5 per cent led by (1) operating leverage benefit, (2) commodity tailwinds, (3) favourable forex and (4) lower discounts in 4QFY24,"" it said.
ICICI Securities sees MSIL profit soaring 56 per cent YoY to Rs 4,084 crore on 22 per cent YoY jump in sales at Rs 39,130 crore.

Macrotech Developers: The company, operating under the 'Lodha' brand, has increased its pre-sales forecast for 2024-25 by 20% to ₹17,500 crore, backed by robust demand and a strong launch pipeline, according to a senior company official. The Mumbai-based developer achieved a record high of ₹14,520 crore in pre-sales in FY24. On Wednesday, the real estate firm reported an 11% decrease in consolidated net profit to ₹665.5 crore for the March quarter.

The RBI identified deficiencies and non-compliances in several areas of the bank's IT system for the years 2022 and 2023, including IT inventory management, patch and change management, user access management, vendor risk management, and data security. A spokesperson for Kotak Mahindra Bank stated in a release that the bank has implemented measures to adopt new technologies to bolster its IT systems and will continue to collaborate with the RBI to promptly address remaining issues.

The company's revenue for the January-March quarter is expected to reach ₹5,153 crore, reflecting a 13.3 percent QoQ growth.

"Stocks Profiting from the Rise of the Luxury Class in India - Profit Hunter 
by Equitymaster","As per a Fortune India article, in FY24, one in every four Mercedes-Benz cars sold in India was a top end vehicle, costing over Rs 1.5 crore. What's more, the company posted its highest ever sales in India in the March quarter. The management was not prepared for this it seems. Their challenge is that they are down to the last units of their best-selling luxury sedan in India. They may run out of stock soon. The new E class is expected to come only by the end of the year. The rise of the luxury class in India has taken everyone by surprise. Demand has outstripped supply. Luxury vehicles sold in India grew 20% YoY in 2023. The growth could have been more if the supplies were planned better. This is a broad trend. SUVs sales are racing past the overall passenger vehicle category volume growth. SUV's share in personal vehicles is expected to rise from 51% to 62% by FY25. Overall, the average selling price of a passenger vehicle is up 50% in last five years. And it's not just cars. The personal luxury market is expected to grow at 12% as per industry reports. That beats GDP growth by a decent margin. --- Advertisement --- Investment in securities market are subject to market risks.

See This Page for More Details Details of our SEBI Research Analyst registration are mentioned on our website - www.equitymaster.com--------------------------------------------------- The opportunity is not lost on Western luxury brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, and others. They are renting space in luxury retail malls and have even signed leases in Jio World Plaza. The domestic sales volume of luxury houses priced at Rs 4 crore or more was up 75% YoY in 2023. Once looked down upon as a land of snake charmers, India is now hogging limelight for beating other developed nations in adding billionaires. Mumbai has taken over Beijing in China on this stat. And there is more. Last week, 471,000 passengers travelled by air - recording the highest single day air traffic ever in the country. Such news across different sectors suggest a trend you should take note of. While FMCG companies are fretting over inflation and slowdown in the growth, the 'premiumisation' and luxury theme is gliding well on lubricated wheels. With a favourable demographic dividend and aspiring millennials, luxury and premiumisation are likely to be structural growth trends. You see, when the income and affordability rise, discretionary consumption takes a disproportionate leap. Money becomes a way to not just meet basic needs, but aspirations, pleasure, and vanity. People switch to brands. Consolidation happens. Value migration and premiumisation unfold. For investors, this could throw up great investment opportunities.

Consider Ethos, Brand Concepts, and Titan. As I started this article highlighting luxury cars, I would like to spend some time on the company named Landmark Cars - India's premier dealership for premium and luxury cars. Around 80% of its revenue comes from new vehicle sales. The other 20% is from aftersales, preowned vehicles sales, and finance and insurance. Landmark Cars is number one partner for brands like Mercedes, Volkswagen, Renault, and BYD. It's well on its way to on-board MG Motors and Mahindra SUV. Diversification across multiple brands is good in case launches in a particular brand slow down, and to mitigate cyclicality. With 12 new launches, it expects significant growth in Mercedes brands itself this year. The company has been a prominent player in North and West India. And is now expanding presence in the South. Its preowned car business is profitable and is expected to double in a year. In last two years, i.e.,...",4 hours ago,1

"Nifty 50, Sensex today: Why is Indian stock market expected to open lower 
in trade on April 25; Explained | Mint","The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open lower on Thursday amid weak global market cues. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a negative start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 22,350 level, a discount of nearly 60 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Wednesday, the domestic equity indices registered fourth straight session of gains, with the benchmark Nifty 50 closing above the 22,400 level. The Sensex gained 114.49 points, or 0.16%, to close at 73,852.94, while the Nifty 50 settled 34.40 points, or 0.15%, higher at 22,402.40. Nifty 50 formed a small negative candle on the daily chart with minor upper shadow. Also Read: Indian stock market: 7 key things that changed for market overnight - Gift Nifty, fall in Meta shares to Treasury yields “Technically, this pattern indicates range bound movement in the market around 22,450 - 22,500 levels. Nifty is currently placed near the crucial overhead resistance of previous opening downside gap of 15th April around 22,500 levels. As long as the Nifty fails to show any sharp decline from near the key resistance, there is a higher possibility of a decisive upside breakout of the said resistance in the near term,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. He believes the short-term trend of Nifty is range bound with positive bias. “The present range bound action could eventually result in a decisive upside breakout in the near term. A decisive move above 22,500 is expected to open the next upside target of 22,800 levels in the near term,"" Shetti added. Also Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today — April 25 Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty OI DataAnalysis of Nifty Put options indicates a concentration of Open Interest (OI) at the 22,000 level, suggesting potential support for the ongoing expiry. On the Call side, significant OI concentrations are observed at the 22,500 and 22,700 levels, nearing all-time highs. Sustaining prices above these levels could propel the market towards the 22,800 strike prices, which might serve as resistance levels for the upcoming expiry. Traders and investors are advised to consider buying opportunities during Nifty dips and to implement a suitable stop-loss strategy below the mentioned support levels, said Mandar Bhojane, Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Also Read: Market fear gauge VIX sees sharpest fall in 5 yr before change in Nifty lot size Nifty 50 PredictionThe Nifty 50 index closed the choppy session on April 24 higher by 34 points above the 22,400 level. “The Nifty remained sideways throughout the session before closing with a slight gain. Sentiment for the short term continues to remain positive as the index closed above the critical moving average. The positive crossover in the RSI also supports the positive momentum. On the higher end, immediate resistance is placed at 22,500,"" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities. He is of the view that a decisive move above 22,500 might take the index towards 22,750 - 22,800 over the short term, while support is placed at 22,350-22,400. Also Read: Stock market today: Three stocks under F&O ban list on April 25 Bank Nifty PredictionThe Bank Nifty index ended extended gains for the fourth consecutive session to end 219 points higher at 48,189, forming a small bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. “The Bank Nifty saw a sideways trading session following a positive start, holding firm around the support zone of 48,000 - 47,800. Immediate resistance is noted at 48,500, and a decisive breakthrough could signal further upside towards 49,500 / 50,000 levels,"" said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities. With the overall sentiment remaining bullish, any pullbacks towards the support zone should be viewed as buying opportunities, Shah added.

"Market Close Highlights : Sensex ends up 110pts, Nifty at 22400; IT, Auto 
down","Market Close Highlights : European stocks struggled to make headway on Wednesday, with a rally in technology stocks barely keeping the benchmark afloat amid disappointing earnings in the banking and luxury sectors. The Stoxx Europe 600 edged about 0.2% higher after its biggest two-day advance since November. The tech sector climbed 2.5%. ASM International NV surged after orders beat expectations, with chipmakers also taking heart from an upbeat outlook by US peer Texas Instruments Inc. Banks weighed on the index, with Lloyds Banking Group Plc falling after missing estimates for lending income. Svenska Handelsbanken AB slumped as much as 11% after Sweden’s largest property lender reported earnings for the first quarter that missed analyst estimates. Kering SA tumbled, dragging luxury peers lower, after warning that profit will plunge on slowing sales at Gucci, its biggest brand. US equity futures advanced, with contracts on the Nasdaq 100 outperforming. Tesla Inc.’s gains alone represented about a third of the rally in Nasdaq futures, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased the most in a month, with chip-related stocks among the best performers. In addition to the strong performance of the US tech giants in Tuesday’s Wall Street rally, weakness in measures of business activity in the world’s largest economy also helped keep alive forecasts for Federal Reserve policy easing this year. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher and a gauge of the dollar was steady. The S&P 500 notched its best back-to-back rally in two months. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the artificial-intelligence boom, led a surge in chipmakers. Texas Instruments Inc. gave a bullish revenue forecast — a good sign for the chip industry that helped lift Asian and European producers on Wednesday.

Top 10 stocks for today â 25th April 2024,"By continuing, I accept the T&C and agree to receive communication on Whatsapp 25 Apr 2024 , 08:57 AM Here are some of the stocks that may see significant price movement today. Hindustan Unilever: The FMCG major reported standalone net profit of ₹2,406 Crore for the quarter ended March FY24, a 5.7% decrease from the previous year, owing to disappointing topline and operating performance.

"Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on 
April 24 | Mint","The Indian stock market indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Wednesday following gains in global markets. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a strong start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 22,450 level, a premium of nearly 80 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Tuesday, the Indian stock market indices continued the upward momentum and ended higher for the third consecutive session. The Sensex gained 89.83 points, or 0.12%, to close at 73,738.45, while the Nifty 50 settled 31.60 points, or 0.14%, higher at 22,368.00. Nifty formed a small negative candle on Tuesday after the formation of doji type candle pattern on Monday, which is indicating ongoing range bound movement in the market. Also Read: Indian stock market: 7 key things that changed for market overnight - Gift Nifty, Tesla Q1 results to US PMI data “Nifty is currently placed near the crucial overhead resistance of opening downside gap at 22,500 levels (15th April). The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily timeframe chart. Having formed a new higher bottom on 19th April at 21,777, the chances of higher top formation is likely,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. He believes the near-term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact and the short-term trend is choppy. “Further consolidation or minor dip could be a buying opportunity. A sustainable move above 22,500 could open next upside towards 22,800 levels,"" Shetti added. Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty OI DataAnalyzing the Nifty Open Interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side was observed at the 22,500 followed by the 22,600 strike prices. Conversely, on the put side, the highest OI was recorded at the 22,100 strike price, said Mandar Bhojane, Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Also Read: Stock market today: Day trading guide for Nifty 50 to Sensex, six stocks to buy or sell today — April 24 Nifty 50 PredictionThe upside momentum with range bound action continued in the market on April 23 and the Nifty 50 index closed the day higher by 31 points amidst a choppy movement. “The Nifty remained sideways throughout the session as it failed to provide any directional breakout. However, the overall trend remains positive as the index closed above the critical moving average. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bullish crossover with a reading below 60. On the higher end, the range of 22,350 - 22,400 is likely to act as a resistance zone; a decisive breakout above 22,400 might trigger a rally in the market,"" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities. On the lower end, he believes the support is positioned at 22,250 and a breach below this level might weaken the bullish sentiment. Also Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today — April 24 Bank Nifty PredictionThe Bank Nifty index closed 46 points higher at 47,970 on Tuesday, forming a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. “The Bank Nifty index experienced a sideways trading session following a positive opening, with bears asserting dominance at higher levels. Despite this, the overall sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that dips should be seen as buying opportunities. Strong support is observed around the 47,800 - 47,700 zone. However, the immediate hurdle lies at 48,200 - 48,500,"" said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities. A breakthrough above this resistance could pave the way for the index to achieve fresh all-time high levels, Shah added.

""The next higher targets expected are Rs 10,250-11,050 levels in the medium-term timeframe with the Rs 8,150 zone as major support area.

"Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on 
April 22 | Mint","The Indian stock market indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open higher on Monday tracking gains in Asian peers amid mixed global cues. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a gap-up start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around the 22,240 level, a premium of nearly 110 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Friday, the domestic equity indices ended sharply higher with the benchmark Nifty 50 closing above the 22,100 level. The Sensex rallied 599.34 points, or 0.83%, to close at 73,088.33, while the Nifty 50 settled 151.15 points, or 0.69%, higher at 22,147.00. Nifty 50 formed a long bull candle on the daily chart after opening at the lows. “The present chart pattern is indicating a formation of bullish piercing line type candle pattern and this signals short-term bottom reversal for the market. Nifty held above the support around 21,750 levels, which is near to the previous swing low of 20th March. This could be considered as a double bottom type formation. After breaking below the support of the lower end of the channel at 22,000 levels, the Nifty regained the lost ground and closed above that support on Friday,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. He believes the short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed up after forming a bullish reversal-type candle pattern on Friday. One may expect further upside towards the next resistance of around 22,500 levels in the few sessions.

Additionally, the indicator has surpassed the 55-EMA (Exponential Moving Average), a short-term moving average. A close above this moving average signifies a positive short-term trend. Looking ahead, bulls may drive the Nifty’s recovery towards 22,300,"" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities. Furthermore, he believes, a decisive breakthrough above 22,300 could trigger a sustained rally toward 22,600. On the downside, support on a closing basis is situated at 22,000. Also Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today — April 22 Bank Nifty PredictionThe Bank Nifty index closed 505 points higher at 47,574 on Friday. “The Bank Nifty Index displayed strong bullish momentum as it formed a bullish piercing candlestick pattern from the support level of 46,500. The immediate resistance for the index is located at 48,000, where there is a significant buildup of open interest on the call side, indicating a potential hurdle. The index has established immediate support between 47,200 and 47,000,"" said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities. Any pullbacks towards this support zone are seen as buying opportunities, suggesting continued bullish sentiment if these levels hold, Shah added.

   Indian Hotels share price today opened at  ₹590 apiece on NSE, the stock touched an intraday low of  ₹582.50 and an intraday high of  ₹599.70 apiece. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One, said that Indian Hotels share prices have seen a gap down opening, and we are seeing follow-up selling. Immediate support is at  ₹580, which would be very crucial as a break below it could trigger further selloffs likely towards  ₹560.
   The hotel firm reported an in-line Q4FY24 with standalone RevPar increase of 15% (LFL adjusted for Ginger Mumbai effect), said domestic brokerage Nuvama Institutional Equities. Overall, the performance of the subsidiaries, especially Ginger (Roots Corp.), is strong and consistent. US activities are still not strong. Indian Hotels presented bold capital expenditure plans of  ₹2,500 crore for the fiscal years FY25–27E.
   The firm has maintained its ""hold"" rating on the stock and increased its target price from  ₹476 to  ₹578.
   ""At our target price, Indian Hotels valuation works out to 26x FY26E EBITDA compared to its pre-covid average of 20x. Q1FY25 could be volatile due to potential impact from elections,"" said the brokerage.

   According to Brokerage Antique Stock Broking, its expectations were met with consolidated revenue for 4QFY24 of  ₹1,910 crore, up 17% YoY. For the first time since the recovery, single-digit ARR growth has been noticed, and both RevPar and ARR fell short of projections for the previous twelve quarters.
   The brokerage highlighted that the management anticipates double-digit revenue growth in FY25, led by measures related to asset management, new business ventures, and portfolio expansion with the launch of 25 hotels. The business predicts a protracted upswing in the hotel sector, propelled by rising demand and constrained supply expansion. Expected growth for new brands and reinvented companies is about +30% YoY. The firm intends to expedite the development of new hotel brands in developing micromarkets in metro areas and Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
   “We maintain HOLD rating, given the current valuation, and maintain the target price at  ₹500 as the results were in line with our estimates. We continue to value Indian Hotels at 24x EV/EBITDA on FY26E EBITDA,"" the brokerage said.

Indian Stock Market: Exchanges and Indexes,"With its massive population and bustling economy, India is an engine of growth. On Jan. 22, 2024, its stock market capitalization surpassed Hong Kong’s for the first time. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the value of shares listed on Indian exchanges reached $4.33 trillion, compared to $4.29 trillion for Hong Kong. Most of the trading in the Indian stock market takes place on its two stock exchanges: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The BSE was established in 1875. The NSE was founded in 1992 and started trading in 1994. Both exchanges follow the same trading mechanism, trading hours, and settlement process. As of Jan. 30, 2024, the BSE had 5,315 listed firms, whereas the rival NSE had 2,266 as of Dec. 31, 2023. Almost all the significant firms of India are listed on both exchanges. The BSE is the older stock market, and the NSE is the largest in volume. Trading on both exchanges is through an open electronic limit order book where order matching is done by the trading computer. There are no market makers, and the entire process is order-driven by investors matched with the best limit orders. Buyers and sellers remain anonymous. An order-driven market brings more transparency by displaying all buy and sell orders in the trading system. Institutional investors can use the direct market access (DMA) option, using trading terminals provided by brokers for placing orders directly into the stock market trading system. Equity spot markets follow a T+1 rolling settlement, with any trade on Monday getting settled by Tuesday. All trading is conducted between 9:15 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Indian Standard Time (+ 5.5 hours GMT), Monday through Friday. Delivery of shares must be made in dematerialized form. Each exchange has its own clearing house, which assumes all settlement risk by serving as a central counterparty. The two prominent Indian market indexes are Sensex and Nifty. Sensex is the oldest market index for equities; it includes shares of 30 firms listed on the BSE. It was created in 1986 and provides time series data from 1979 as the base year. The Standard and Poor's CNX Nifty includes 50 shares listed on the NSE. It was created in 1996. The development, regulation, and supervision of India's stock market rests with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), formed in 1992 as an independent authority. Since then, SEBI has consistently tried to lay down market rules in line with the best market practices. It enjoys vast powers of imposing penalties on market participants in case of a breach. India permitted outside investments in the 1990s. Foreign investments are classified into two categories: foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). All investments in which an investor takes part in the day-to-day management and operations of the company are treated as FDI, whereas investments in shares without any control over management and operations are treated as FPI. To make portfolio investments in India, one must be a foreign institutional investor (FII) or one of the sub-accounts of one of the registered FIIs. Both registrations are granted by the market regulator, SEBI. Foreign institutional investors mainly consist of mutual funds, pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, banks, and asset management companies. FIIs can also invest in unlisted securities outside stock exchanges, subject to the approval of the price by the Reserve Bank of India. India has the fifth-largest economy in the world by GDP, with a 2023 GDP of $3.7 trillion. The government of India prescribes the FDI limit, and different ceilings have been prescribed for different sectors. The maximum limit for portfolio investment in a particular listed firm is decided by the FDI limit prescribed for the sector to which the firm belongs. However, there are two additional restrictions on portfolio investment. According to SEBI, an FII can invest up to 10% of the equity of any one company, subject to the 24% limit on overall investments. The 24% limit may be raised to 30% for individual companies that have received shareholder approval to do so. FIIs are allowed to invest 100% of their portfolios in debt securities. Foreign entities and individuals can gain exposure to Indian stocks through institutional investors. Investments can be made through some of the offshore instruments, like participatory notes (PNs), depositary receipts, such as American depositary receipts (ADRs) and global depositary receipts (GDRs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchange-traded notes (ETNs). Participatory notes representing underlying Indian stocks can be issued offshore by...","Jan 30, 2024",1

"Buy or sell: Aarti Industries to IGL, Vaishali Parekh recommends three 
stocks to buy today â April 24 | Mint","Buy or sell stocks for today: Frontline indices Nifty 50 and Sensex settled higher for the third consecutive session yesterday driven by firm global cues and easing Middle East conflict. A major drop in the volatility index indicated that market participants are confident about the near-term trajectory. Nifty 50 closed the day at 22,368, up 32 points, or 0.14 per cent, while Sensex ended with a small gain of 90 points, or 0.12 per cent, at 73,738.45 as gains in shares of select heavyweights such as ITC, Bharti Airtel, and Infosys were largely offset by losses in shares of Reliance Industries. The fear gauge India VIX which indicates how much the Nifty 50 index is expected to change in the next 30 days, fell 20 per cent to reach near the level of 10. Mid and smallcap indices outperformed the benchmarks. The BSE midcap index rose 0.52 per cent and the smallcap index jumped 1.05 per cent. Additionally, gold prices extended losses for a second session to hit a more than two-week low as diminishing fears about an escalation of tensions in the Middle East prompted investors to book profits ahead of US economic data this week. Oil prices rose a dollar a barrel in the previous session as the US dollar index fell to its lowest in over a week and as investors shifted focus away towards global economies. Brent crude futures rose $1.29, or 1.5 per cent, to $88.29 per barrel.

The Prabhudas Lilladher expert added that for Bank Nifty, the zone near 46,800 levels would remain as the important support zone for the index as of now. Coming to the stocks that investors can buy, Vaishali Parekh recommended three intraday stocks for today —IGL, Grasim Industries, and Aarti Industries. Stock market todayOn the outlook for the Nifty 50's performance today, Vaishali Parekh said, ‘’Nifty 50 has maintained above the 22,300 zone with bias remaining positive and would need to cross the hurdle around 22,500 levels to establish conviction to carry on with the positive move further ahead.'' ‘’Bank Nifty has been hovering near the 48,000 zone with bias maintained positive and would need a decisive breach above 48,400 levels to confirm clarity and anticipate for further rise,'' she said. Parekh added that for Nifty 50 the support for the day is seen at 22,200 levels while the resistance is seen near 22,500 levels. Bank Nifty would have the daily range of 47,500-48,500 levels.

"Weekly Stocks: Motilal Oswal recommends these three shares with strong 
upside potential | Mint","Indian stock market: The Sensex and the Nifty 50, key benchmarks of the Indian stock market, continued to climb for the second consecutive session, on Monday.

Oil prices too have eased off to $86 following reduced geopolitical tension and expectation of OPEC to increase oil production. On the domestic front, hope of normal monsoon and above expected direct tax collection added fuel to the market sentiments.

"SBI shares: State Bank of India hits Rs 800 level! Where the PSU bank stock 
headed?","Feedback
Shares of State Bank of India Ltd (SBI) hit fresh record high in Monday's trade nd in the process it breached Rs 800-mark for the first ever. The stock gained amid a broad-based rally in banking shares after a couple of healthy quarterly earnings. 
Th PSU banking stock climbed 4.23 per cent to hit an all-time high of Rs 805.95. 
Rajesh Palviya, Head Technical Research at Axis Securities lies State Bank of India (SBI) among PSU banks. ""The stock could see Rs 820-830 levels in the next 2-3 days. One can maintain stop loss at Rs 750,"" Palviya said. 
The third largest lender rallied on a day Axis Bank pipped Kotak Mahindra Bank to become the fourth-largest lender in terms of market capitalisation (m-cap) following its March quarter results.  Other bank stocks also gained, even, as Kotak Mahindra Bank shares plunged following the RBI ban on onboarding customers online and via mobile banking and also its ban on Kotak's fresh credit card acquisitions.
For the March quarter, Axis Securities estimated SBI's advances and deposits growth at 14 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Opex is likely to remain marginally higher to account for wage revision, though pre-provision operating profit may improve sequentially, the brokerage said.
Earlier this month, Fitch Ratings said SBI's business profile score is the highest among Indian banks, reflecting its view of SBI's ability to generate business consistently through the cycle while managing risk better than peer state banks. 
""It also reflects the competitive advantages of its dominant size and market share and unparalleled domestic reach that offset the sector's limited pricing power. Still, government influence can weigh on SBl's traditional business model - loans are about 60 per cent of assets -and even more so on its risk appetite, similar to other state banks,"" it said.
Fitch Ratings talked about SBI's advantage over peers in portfolio selection due to scale, brand loyalty and widespread presence. It said SBI's bank's appetite for risk has been higher than is typical for a bank with its market position - despite total loan growth slowing to 14.5 per cent YoY in 9MFY24 from 16 epr cent in the financial year ended March 2023 (FY23). 
Meanwhile, NSE recently announced a revision in the lot size for derivative contracts for 54 stocks including State Bank of India, which will be effective from April 26.

"Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on 
April 23 | Mint","The Indian stock market indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Tuesday led by positive global cues. The trends on Gift Nifty indicate a flat start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading flat at around 22,370 levels. On Monday, the domestic equity indices ended sharply higher for the second consecutive session, with the Nifty closing above the 22,300 level. The Sensex rallied 560.29 points, or 0.77%, to close at 73,648.62, while the Nifty 50 settled 189.40 points, or 0.86%, higher at 22,336.40. Nifty 50 formed a small candle on the daily chart with an identical open and close and with a long lower shadow. Also Read: Indian stock market: 6 key things that changed for market overnight - Gift Nifty, Japan PMI to Reliance Q4 results “This market action indicates a formation of long legged doji or dragonfly doji type candle pattern. Having formed this pattern after one day of upmove, this doesn’t signal any significant alertness for bulls at the highs. Nifty has moved above the initial hurdle at 22,300 levels and is expected to encounter strong resistance at 22,500 levels (opening downside gap of 15th April) in the short term,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. He believes if Nifty manages to sustain above 22,500, then the market could even reach new all-time highs in the near term. Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty OI DataAnalysis of Nifty Put options reveals a concentration of Open Interest (OI) at the 22,000 level, suggesting potential support for the ongoing expiry. On the Call side, significant OI concentrations are observed at the 22,500 and 22,600 levels, nearing an all-time high. “Maintaining prices above this level could propel the market towards the 22,800 strike prices, which could act as potential resistance levels for the upcoming expiry. Traders and investors are encouraged to consider buying opportunities during Nifty dips and implement a suitable stop-loss strategy below the mentioned support levels,"" said Mandar Bhojane, Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Also Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today — April 23 Nifty 50 PredictionBulls continued to dominate the market as the Nifty 50 index continued with a follow-through upmove on April 22 and closed the day higher by 189 points. “The trend has turned positive after reclaiming a critical near-term moving average. Sentiment is expected to remain favorable for bulls as long as it stays above 22,150. On the upside, the index could potentially move towards 22,600-22,700,"" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities. Conversely, according to him, a drop below 22,150 could lead to consolidation in the index. Also Read: Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, 7 stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday — April 23 Bank Nifty PredictionThe Bank Nifty index extended gains and ended 351 points higher at 47,925 on Monday. “The Bank Nifty index exhibited continued bullish strength as it witnessed follow-up buying from lower levels. Currently, it is approaching a crucial resistance level of around 48,000, marked by the highest open interest on the call side. A decisive break above this level is anticipated to trigger further short-covering moves,"" said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities. Meanwhile, immediate support lies at 47,600 - 47,500 levels, suggesting that any dip towards this support zone could present a buying opportunity, Shah added.

Motilal's top stock picks ahead of Lok Sabha elections 2024,"Feedback
Motilal Oswal Securities in its latest strategy note cited various opinion polls to suggest BJP may retain power for the third consecutive term with a full majority. Motilal Oswal said BJP's Sankalpa Patra (Manifesto) titled “Modi ki Guarantee 2024”, unveiled by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reflects the confidence of the current dispensation to return to power and thus refrains from any meaningful freebies, which would have extracted a fiscal cost.
It said India is in a mini-Goldilocks set-up, thanks to solid macro (GDP, inflation, CAD, stable currency) and resilient micros (corporate earnings). Besides, the expectations of political continuity with an acceleration in policy momentum (as promised in the BJP manifesto) in the potential third term of the BJP under PM Modi augur well for stock markets for the short to medium term, the domestic brokerage said.
A present, Nifty is trading well within its long-period average PE of 20 times FY25E EPS. Motilal Oswal said it continued to stay 'overweight' on domestic cyclicals such as BFSI, industrials, real estate and consumer discretionary, It maintained its underweight on IT with Equal Weight on Healthcare, Automobile, Metals, O&G and Telecom.
Among large cap stocks, Motilal Oswal prefers stocks such as ICICI Bank Ltd, State Bank of India (SBI), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Titan Company Ltd, ITC Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Coal India Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Zomato Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd.
Among mid cap stocks, it like Indian Hotels Ltd, Godrej Properties Ltd, Global Health Ltd, PNB Housing, KOEL, Cello World, Sobha Ltd, Lemon Tree Hotel Ltd, KEI Industries Ltd and JK Cement Ltd.
The Modi-led BJP in its 2024 manifesto emphasised policy continuity, better execution and widening the scope of existing priorities (Housing, Ayushman Bharat, Physical and Digital Infrastructure), along with some big-bang political agenda, such as Uniform Civil Code, Implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act and One Nation, One Election.
""The manifesto focuses on broadbased development through various government programs and initiatives that will
have socio-economic impacts. Infrastructure development (Roads, Railways, Airports, Metros, Inland Waterways, Shipping), manufacturing (developing India as Global Manufacturing Hub) and capex will remain the key priorities. On the social front, the BJP plans to continue to provide free ration for the next five years under PMGKAY, double the limit of Mudra loans to INR2m and expand the scope of Ayushman Bharat to cover senior citizens,"" Motilal Oswal said.
The manifesto also mentions the “Neo Middle Class” population and emphasises providing them with quality healthcare and education, along with fulfilling their dream of owning a home.
""Key economic proposals include the focus on building India as a key manufacturing hub (Electronics, Defense, Aviation, Railways, Renewable Energy), strengthening digital and physical infrastructure, and empowering MSMEs. Providing piped natural gas connections to all major cities and towns is outlined as another priority,"" Motilal Oswal said.

India Stocks Can Keep Good Times Going in 2024,,"Jan 5, 2024",1
Crorepati stocks! 10 shares turned Rs 1 lakh to up to Rs 6 crore in 5 years,"Feedback
The stock market holds the potential to transform fortunes for those skilled in choosing the perfect stock at precisely the right moment. Data showed that at least 10 small-cap stocks on Dalal Street have delivered over 100 times returns to investors in the last five years. On the other hand, the BSE Smallcap index gained 91% during the same period. A stock from the renewable sector--Waaree Renewable Technologies--emerged as the top gainer on the list.
 
Shares of the company have soared 664.6 times to Rs 2,499.20 on April 22, 2024, from just Rs 3.76 on April 22, 2019. The rise means that an investment of Rs 100,000 in Waaree Renewable Technologies has now turned to over Rs 6.6 crore. The company posted a profit of Rs 55.42 crore in FY23 against a loss of Rs 1.91 crore in FY19.
Achin Goel, Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio is bullish on the renewable sector. “The ongoing shift towards clean energy presents opportunities for companies involved in solar, wind, and other renewable technologies,” he said.
With a gain of more than 500 times, Diamond Power Infrastructure and Integrated Industries are among the next gainers. Diamond Power Infrastructure is engaged in the business of manufacturing, transmission and distribution of power products and services in the country. On the other hand, Integrated Industries is engaged in the business of organic and inorganic foods products, bakery products, and other processed foods items.

Divam Sharma, Founder and Fund Manager, Green Portfolio said, “Some of the sectors we are currently looking at are telecom, infrastructure, and chemicals. We have investments in some amazing companies here. However, we’re not going towards mainstream companies because of prevailing valuation concerns. We’re going deeper into value chains instead to generate alpha.”

"Buy or sell: Sumeet Bagadia recommends three stocks to buy on Monday â 
April 22 | Mint","Buy or sell stocks: Following weak global market sentiments on rising fears of the Iran-Israel war, the Indian stock market snapped its four-week winning streak. The Nifty 50 index ended 1.65 percent lower in the week gone by at the 22,147 mark, the BSE Sensex logged a weekly loss of 1.56 percent and finished at 73,088 level while the Bank Nifty index lost 2.65 percent last week and closed at 47,574 mark. In the broad market, the small-cap index finished 1.73 percent lower last week whereas the mid-cap index corrected over 3 percent in the truncated week. Buy or sell stock ideas by Choice Broking expertSumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking believes that the Indian stock market bias has improved after the Nifty 50 index closed above the 50-DEMA level of 22,110 zone. However, the Choice Broking expert maintained that the 50-stock index needs to close above 22,350 to 22,400 levels for further improvement of the Dalal Street trends. On stocks to buy on Monday, Sumeet Bagadia recommended three buy or sell stock ideas — ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd or MSIL, and Hindustan Copper. Sumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy on Monday1] ICICI Bank: Buy at ₹1067.25, target ₹1140, stop loss ₹1030. ICICI Bank share price is currently trading at ₹1067.25, having recently retested the daily trendline and formed a bullish piercing pattern, indicating a potential bullish reversal. On the daily scale, ICICI Bank share price is showing a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, suggesting a strong uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ICICIBANK stands at 45.10, indicating room for potential upside in ICICI Bank shares. Additionally, the Stochastic RSI shows a positive crossover, further supporting the bullish sentiment. Notably, the stock is trading above all major moving averages, highlighting its strength in the market. Considering these technical indicators and the prevailing market conditions, the current level of ₹1067.25 presents a favorable buying opportunity for ICICI Bank share price. The trade's target is set at ₹1140, with a recommended stop-loss at ₹1030 to manage potential risks. In summary, based on the technical analysis and current market dynamics, initiating a long position on ICICI Bank share price at the current market price is advantageous, with a target of ₹1140 and a prudent stop-loss set at ₹1030. Traders should stay vigilant and adjust their strategies in response to changing market conditions. 2] Maruti Suzuki: Buy at ₹12711, target ₹13700, stop loss at ₹12050. Maruti share price displays an intriguing technical landscape. Currently, the stock is trading very close to its all-time high levels of ₹12895.70 at ₹12710.95 levels. Once the Maruti share price crosses the mentioned all-time high levels we can witness a sharp up move in Maruti shares. The critical support level at ₹12050 levels signifies historical buying interest and provides a foundation for the stock's price stability. This level serves as a potential stop for downward movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.53, indicating a supportive environment for price gains. It's not yet in overbought territory, suggesting room for further growth. Crucially, Maruti share price is trading above all significant moving averages, emphasizing its underlying strength and positive sentiment. Based on the above analysis we recommend buying Maruti share price at the CMP of ₹12710.95, it can also be purchased on dips near ₹12350 with a stop loss of ₹12050 for the targets of ₹13700 and above. 3] Hindustan Copper: Buy at ₹364.10, target ₹430, stop loss ₹320. Hindustan Copper share is currently trading at ₹364.10, consolidating above the 345 level for the last weak, reaching an all-time high, indicating price stability. This upward momentum is supported by a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart, accompanied by robust trading volume. These patterns underscore a strong upward trajectory in the stock. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) Hindustan Copper shares stand at 73.25 and are on an upward trend, signifying a significant surge in buying momentum. Both RSI and Stochastic RSI in the overbought region suggest that positional traders may consider holding their positions, and implementing a trailing stop-loss. The overall trend for HINDCOPPER is bullish, with confluence from various technical indicators reinforcing the optimistic outlook. Given these signals, there is potential for the stock to achieve a target price of ₹430 in the near term. It is advisable to consider buying on dips, particularly around ₹340, capitalizing on potential retracements in the stock price. To prudently manage risk, implementing a stop-loss (SL) at ₹320 is recommended. This...",6 days ago,1

"Parliament approves first ever EU rules on combating violence against women 
| News | European Parliament","The new rules aim to prevent gender-based violence and protect its victims, especially women and victims of domestic violence.
Parliament adopted on Wednesday, with 522 in favour, 27 against, and 72 abstentions, the first ever EU rules on combating violence against women and domestic violence. The directive calls for stronger laws against cyberviolence, better assistance for victims, and steps to prevent rape.
The new rules prohibit female genital mutilation and forced marriage and outline particular guidelines for offenses committed online, such as the disclosure of private information and cyberflashing.
The new legislation will include a longer list of aggravating circumstances for offenses that carry more severe penalties, such as crimes against public figures, journalists, or human rights defenders. The list also includes the intention to punish victims based on their gender, sexual orientation, skin colour, religion, social origin, or political beliefs, and the desire to maintain or restore “honour.”
Sexual and reproductive health services to be made available
The safety and well-being of victims should be prioritised, including through access to sheltered accommodation. Healthcare should be made accessible, including sexual and reproductive health services. Member states authorities will have enhanced reporting and evidence gathering obligations, and will have to raise public awareness of the fact that non-consensual sex is considered a criminal offence.
Due to Parliament’s insistence, the Commission will report every five years on whether the rules should be revised.
Quotes
The co-rapporteur from the Women’s Rights and Gender Equality Committee, Frances Fitzgerald (EPP, IE), said: “Today Parliament has taken the first steps to make Europe the first continent in the world to end violence against women. This is a wide-ranging piece of legislation that will prevent violence against women, protect victims and prosecute perpetrators, thereby ensuring a holistic approach to tackling these heinous crimes. There can be no equality without eradication of violence against women; we must ensure that there can be no impunity for those who commit such crimes.”
The co-rapporteur from the Civil Liberties Committee, Evin Incir (S&D, SV), said: “This ground-breaking directive embodies our unwavering commitment to strengthening the rights of women and saving lives. As we march forward, let us remember this moment as a first historic step in strengthening women's rights and illuminating the path towards a future where every woman can live free from fear and oppression. This is a victory for justice and equality across the European Union.”
Next steps
The new rules will come into force twenty days after their publication in the EU Official Journal. Member states have three years to implement the provisions.",2 days ago,1

LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS)



  
The workshop provided an opportunity for participants to  reflect on the practical experiences and continuing challenges faced by LDCs in  harnessing technological advances for their economic progress. It provided a  platform for dialogue on the technological needs and priorities of LDCs, while  allowing for an in-depth analysis of technology transfer programmes reported by  developed members in furtherance of their commitments under Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement.
 Speaking at the opening session of the workshop, WTO  Deputy Director-General Johanna Hill indicated that since 2003, when the TRIPS  Council agreed on the transparency mechanism for the implementation of Article  66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, developed members have submitted 318 reports  detailing various actions taken or envisaged in terms of technology transfer.
 She noted that the WTO Secretariat has been organizing  this workshop since 2008 to help LDC members and observers analyze these  reports and engage in direct dialogue with the reporting delegations. The  reports and the discussions in the TRIPS Council offer a wealth of  comprehensive information essential to carry out the necessary detailed  analytical work.
 Ambassador Pimchanok Pitfield of Thailand, Chair of  the Council for TRIPS, further explained that these reports help members  understand the range and character of technology transfer mechanisms and can  help determine how best to shape programmes to meet LDC priority needs.  
 Stressing the importance of the connection created  between the workshop and the TRIPS Council meeting, she encouraged  participants, particularly LDC members, to use the platform to examine the  reports in more detail than is possible at formal Council meetings. 
 Health, agriculture and the environment remained among  the identified priority needs, as outlined by Ambassador Kadra Ahmed Hassan of  Djibouti, coordinator of the WTO's LDC Group. She also pointed out that the  programme was designed to actively involve all participants in the subsequent  meeting of the TRIPS Council, thereby increasing the impact of the workshop on  the Council's work in this area.

Erik ten Hag: Manchester United boss snubs journalists in news conference,"Erik ten Hag banned journalists from four media outlets from a news conference in December
Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag banned three media outlets from asking questions at his news conference on Friday.
The Dutchman did not take questions from the Sun, the Mirror and the Manchester Evening News.
Their journalists were present at the news conference, but had been made aware in advance they would not be invited to ask questions.
United and Ten Hag were widely criticised after their FA Cup semi-final win over Coventry at Wembley on Sunday.
The Red Devils relinquished a 3-0 lead against the Championship side before winning on penalties.
Ten Hag called the reaction to the game ""embarrassing"" and ""a disgrace"".
Earlier this season, Ten Hag banned journalists from four media outlets after claiming United had not been given right of reply to negative stories around the club.
United, who are sixth in the Premier League, host relegation-threatened Burnley on Saturday.

"After O.J. Simpson's death, Ron Goldman's father and Alan Dershowitz react","

There are no new alerts at this time
The death of O.J. Simpson drew immediate reaction around the country Thursday, renewing public interest in his era-defining 1995 murder trial — and reviving painful memories for the families who were close to the events.
Simpson was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, capping off what legal analysts described at the time as the ""trial of the century.""
Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, told NBC News that the news of Simpson's death only further underscored his grief for his son, who was found stabbed to death outside Brown Simpson's home in Los Angeles on June 12, 1994.
""The only thing I have to say is, it’s just further reminder of Ron being gone all these years,"" Fred Goldman said in a phone interview. ""It’s no great loss to the world. It’s a further reminder of Ron’s being gone.""
In a subsequent statement sent to reporters, Fred Goldman and his daughter, Kim, said they were experiencing a ""mixed bag of complicated emotions.""
""We will continue to advocate for the rights of all victims and survivors, ensuring our voices are heard both within and beyond the courtroom,"" the Goldmans said in part. ""Thank you for keeping our family, and most importantly Ron, in your hearts for the last 30 years.""
Alan Dershowitz, the prominent lawyer who served as an adviser on Simpson's legal ""Dream Team"" alongside Johnnie Cochran and F. Lee Bailey, told NBC News that he was saddened to learn that his onetime client had died.
""I knew he was very sick, so I'm upset that he died,"" Dershowitz said. ""I got to know him fairly well during the trial. It was one of the most divisive trials in American history along racial lines. He'll always be remembered for the Bronco chase, for the glove and for the moment of acquittal.""
Simpson, 76, died of cancer, according to a statement from his family that was posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
""On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer,"" the family said. ""He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren. During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.""
Simpson's team of lawyers also included his friend Robert Kardashian, the late husband of reality television mogul Kris Jenner. The former Olympian and media personality Caitlyn Jenner, who was later married to Kris Jenner until their divorce in 2015, tweeted just two words in response to the news of Simpson's death: ""Good Riddance.""
Marcia Clark, a former Los Angeles deputy district attorney who was the lead prosecutor in the Simpson murder case, released a short statement: ""I send my condolences to Mr. Simpson's family.""
In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Keith Zlomsowitch — Brown Simpson's ex-boyfriend — said Simpson's death was a ""relief."" Zlomsowitch served as a pallbearer at her funeral.
""I think finally some sort of justice has been served, that he’s been taken from the earth,"" Zlomsowitch said. ""So it doesn’t bring Nicole back. But it means he can no longer be who he is in this world.""
Bob Costas, the sports broadcaster who worked with Simpson for years at NBC Sports covering the NFL, said he leaves behind “a complicated legacy, to put it mildly.”
“I can’t think of anyone historical or someone that we may have known where the first chapter and the second chapter of their lives are such a stark contrast … revered and then reviled,” Costas said on NBC’s “TODAY” show Friday. 
In the decades before he earned national infamy as a murder trial defendant, Simpson was best known as a decorated football star and sometime actor, appearing in ""The Naked Gun"" movie franchise.
The Buffalo Bills, the team Simpson spent most of his NFL career with, did not immediately post a comment on his death, but a fan account published a photo of him on Instagram.

Dev Comment: This patch is a little different than our usual balance patches‚Äîit‚Äôs more about the general design direction of the game than it is about particular power outliers (though we hit a few of those, too). Right now, there are a lot of cards that can remove player agency and raise the power level of the game beyond where we want for a 4-set meta. We‚Äôre looking at a variety of these meta-defining cards in this patch, from OTK-style cards to powerful AoE effects that make it feel like your minions don‚Äôt matter. There will always be cool, dreamy cards in Hearthstone‚Äîthat's part of what makes Hearthstone Hearthstone‚Äîbut these types of cards can sometimes be disproportionately more fun to play with than play against. We don‚Äôt want these kinds of cards to make up the most powerful and prevalent archetypes in the game, especially if they create metagames where player agency feels low. There are a few categories of changes in this patch. The first is cards that can end the game quickly when played, and which warp the entire game around whether you get to play them at the right time. No Duplicate cards are also a subsection of this. Being able to draw your deck to avoid the downside of these cards is an interesting deck construction challenge, but it has in large part devolved into turbo-draw decks that tend to be less interactive and not in the spirit of these cards. The second category is powerful, uncapped board clears. We‚Äôve made and will continue to make AoE effects, but these particular instances are too efficient at clearing the board, making minion-based strategies feel helpless. The third category is cards that are just a little too strong in their decks and should be toned down a bit. Similarly, our Wild changes are to some clear power and play experience outliers in that Mode. Finally, we‚Äôre making some buffs, too! A lot of the changes we‚Äôre making in this patch are to weaken new cards or strategies that came from Whizbang‚Äôs Workshop, but we don‚Äôt want to just go back to the meta we had before the expansion. So we‚Äôve identified some underperforming Whizbang‚Äôs Workshop archetypes that we think better align with our overall goals for the format and infusing them with a bit more power to give them another chance. This probably won‚Äôt be a one-and-done fix. We‚Äôre going to keep an eye on the game after these changes go live and continue to push towards a game that aligns with our design philosophy. To read more about this general philosophy, check out our Developer Insights post on the topic from earlier this week.

We're so pleased that players have been enjoying the new Battlegrounds update as well as the new Duos mode! Overall, we are pretty happy with how both game modes are shaping up, but we wanted to help out some underperforming strategies. We went for a very wide approach this patch with a lot of smaller changes to smooth out the meta. We've also hit a few notable outliers, such as Greymane's Champion, Rylak Metalhead, Gem Smuggler, Iridescent Skyblazer, and Orc-estra Conductor, to give other cards more room to shine.

O-Zone: Shhhh,"Jaguars Senior Writer JACKSONVILLE – Let's get to it … Justin from North Augusta, SC O-Zone, today is the day! I definitely feel like we need to take a cornerback at No. 17. I really like Terrion Arnold from Alabama and Quinton Mitchell from Toledo. And I really love Nate Wiggins from Clemson. Let's grab one of those guys in Round 1 and hopefully wide receiver Keon Coleman from Florida State falls in our lap in the second round. After all the mocks you have seen, what is going to happen tonight with the Jags in Round 1? Today indeed is the Day 1 of the 2024 NFL Draft. I don't know that the Jaguars absolutely, positively must select a cornerback with the No. 17 overall selection. Still, I have said and written for weeks – since free agency began and ""ended"" in mid-to-late March – that I believe corner will be the selection there. It feels as if that's where need and value will intersect. That has been my thought and I'm sticking with that thought. I expect the selection will either be Mitchell or Arnold. We'll see what tonight brings. Boy Howdy. Eric from Jacksonville Beach, FL I know I'm not alone but I'm calling right now that the Houston Texans are not back-to-back division champions. I think we showed last year how heavy the crown is and I expect the Texans will feel the new expectations this year with teams gunning for them. There's also a sophomore slump that could be waiting for quarterback C.J. Stroud and I honestly believe, even though he's incredibly talented, that wide receiver Stefon Diggs' attitude is a net negative to the team. Jags back this year to take the division and the momentum in the AFC South! The Texans deserve to be the preseason AFC South favorites entering the 2024 NFL season. They won the division in 2023 and there's no reason to think they won't be good next season. The Jaguars and Texans split the series last season, with each team winning on the opponent's field. The Jaguars held control of the division until the final six games, when quarterback Trevor Lawrence left three of those games with injuries and played through the effects of those injuries. These circumstances don't make the Jaguars overwhelming division favorites. But perhaps they might still have a puncher's chance. Andrew from Hilton Head, SC Picking 17th overall, roughly halfway through the first round, seems like an opportune time to take a commercial break from the broadcast as we're on the clock, wouldn't you agree? If we're able to trade up or back, I'm sure the NFL will make sure we can only trade into another spot primed for a commercial break! If you were a gambling man, what do you think the odds our commercial streak during draft coverage continues?! Those broadcasting the NFL seemingly have taken commercial breaks during Jaguars selections in the past often enough that it is a ""thing"" among Jaguars fans. I say ""seemingly"" because this never has been something I've much noticed. It's not that I don't care. It's just that I'm busy preparing to write – or preparing to analyze, or talking, or analyzing – on draft night and pay little attention to commercial trends during the broadcasts. I don't for a minute believe the NFL will maneuver trades to ensure the Jaguars are in a particular spot. As for how the draft coverage will play out this weekend … I haven't the foggiest. Zach from Jacksonville Draft day is here!!! All the excitement and talk for the occasion of a bunch of kids having their dreams realized while we the fans sit at home and google a player's height, weight, age and college and come to hasty conclusions if our team drafted a ""good"" or ""bad"" player. I pray for Jaguars General Manager Trent Baalke's sake he drafts the player I've taken a liking to reading his name many times and maybe seeing a few highlight plays of while casually watching college football. I'm sure whatever selection the Jaguars make at No. 17 all Jaguars fans will be happy and content. That's typically the reaction. Bo from Linwood, NC I know the Jags' brass is short on sleep going over multiple scenarios prepping for the draft. I wouldn't mind seeing two corners being the Jaguars' first couple of picks. Or maybe a corner and a defensive tackle. Maybe even all defensive selections in general. What say you,...",1 day ago,1

"2024 NFL Draft: Defensive Tackle Byron Murphy II, Texas, No. 16 Overall","Talking about building a successful defense, new Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said earlier this offseason ""we are trying to build a wall up the middle."" On Thursday, the Seahawks took a big step towards building that wall, selecting University of Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy with the 16th overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft. The 6-foot, 306-pound Murphy adds size and playmaking ability to an already talented defensive line, coming to Seattle with credentials as a second-team AP All-American and the Big 12 Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year. ""I'm just very aggressive, a very dominant player,"" Murphy said. ""I can stop the run, rush the passer, I'm an all-three-down type of D-lineman. That's why I feel like I fit perfect in their scheme and their defense."" A first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2023, Murphy started all 14 games, compiling 29 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss and 5.0 sacks while also scoring two touchdowns on offense, one rushing and one receiving. Like any player being drafted, particularly in the first round, Murphy was excited to get the call from the Seahawks on Thursday. ""When I got that call, I was happy, excited,"" He said. ""It was like a dream come true. I'm really just blessed and honored to be a Seattle Seahawk."" But Murphy's excitement extended beyond becoming a first-round pick; he was also thrilled about the team that picked him seeing as he grew up a Seahawks fan despite his Texas upbringing. ""I really loved the Legion of Boom, Earl Thomas, Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Michael Bennett, all those guys, just how dominant they were,"" Murphy said. ""And you had the offensive guys, Russell Wilson, Marshawn (Lynch), Doug Baldwin, (Jermaine) Kearse. Just watching them growing up, they dominated the league, they won a Super Bowl, so growing up watching them do that, man, that's all I ever wanted is to win the Super Bowl. ""It means a lot (being picked by Seattle), it's an honor for them to believe in me and invest in me. I'm going to give them everything I've got. I owe them my everything. Growing up that was my favorite team, so to be drafted by Seattle, it's crazy. I give all glory to God, I feel like it's just God's plan."" Congrats, Seahawks fans. You just drafted Grady Jarrett. Byron Murphy is a bad dude. With the first 14 picks of the draft all being offensive players, a first in NFL draft history, including six quarterbacks, the Seahawks were able to get the second defensive player selected in the entire draft despite picking 16th. Murphy's NFL prospect profile by Lance Zierlein has this to say: ""Muscular ball of explosiveness with the tools and talent to become a productive three-down defender in the right scheme. Twitchy first-step quickness combined with flexion and power in his lower half create a recipe for disruption as a gap shooter or as a pass rusher. ""Murphy is powerful and well-schooled at taking on double-teams but lacks ideal mass and length for that role long-term. He's successful at bypassing protection with sudden hands and quick feet, while his motor and passion create an activity level coaches will love. ""Forget the average physical traits and modest production and focus on his competitive spirit and disruptive qualities. Murphy is ascending and could become a successful nose tackle or 3-technique in an even front."" This is a developing story. Check back soon for additional news and analysis.

"Israel-Gaza updates: 22, including 18 children, reported dead in Rafah 
strikes","The IDF says it struck military targets of terrorist organizations in Gaza. Famine in Gaza: A timeline of how the hunger crisis is unfolding Israel launched a retaliatory strike against Iran early Friday morning local time, a senior U.S. official told ABC News. The strike followed Iran's attack on Saturday, when Tehran sent a volley of more than 300 drones and missiles toward targets in Israel, according to Israeli military officials. All but a few were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States, officials said. Iran's weekend attack came more than six months after Hamas terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, after which the Israeli military began its bombardment of Gaza. Israeli officials said the country's Iron Dome defense system endured a big test from Iran's attack on Saturday, intercepting 99% of the 300 ""threats of various types"" thrown at it. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, according to Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari, launched 170 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more than 120 ballistic missiles and more than 30 cruise missiles in the attack. Hagari said ""99% of the threats launched towards Israeli territory were intercepted -- a very significant strategic achievement."" Hagari said the attack resulted in only one known Israeli casualty, a 7-year-old girl who was severely injured when she was struck by shrapnel apparently from an intercepted missile. Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant held a discussion with IDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi regarding the developing report on U.S. intentions to impose sanctions against the IDF’s Netzach Yehuda battalion, an Israeli military unit operating in the West Bank. ""Any attempt to criticize an entire unit casts a heavy shadow on the actions of the IDF, which operates to protect the citizens of Israel,"" Gallant said in a statement. ""Damage to one battalion, affects the entire defense establishment – this is not the right path for partners and friends."" Gallant urged the U.S. not to impose sanctions on the unit. ""Our friends and our enemies are closely watching the ties between Israel and the United States, now more than ever,"" Gallant said. ""I call on the U.S. Administration to withdraw its intention to impose sanctions on the Netzach Yehuda battalion."" Amid reports of possible sanctions, Gallant recently completed a call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Earlier today, Minister Gallant also held a discussion with the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew. -ABC News' William Gretsky Two strikes were launched on the southern Gaza town of Rafah, killing 22 people, including 18 children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. At least one blast occurred at the Al-Shabora refugee camp in Rafah, a spokesperson for the Kuwait Hospital in Rafah told ABC News. The hospital spokesperson told ABC News doctors were able to rescue an unborn baby whose mother was killed in the blast at Al-Shabora camp. Officials identified the mother as Sabreen Mohamed Al-Sakani. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the strikes, telling ABC News, ""At the given times, the IDF struck several military targets of the terrorist organizations in Gaza including military compounds, launch posts and armed terrorists."" -ABC News' Helena Skinner and Victoria Beaule Israeli forces have withdrawn after a dayslong raid in the Nur Shams area of the Tulkarm camp in the West Bank left 14 ""terrorists"" dead, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Israel Border Police forces ""completed extensive counterterrorism activity based on IDF and ISA (Israel Security Authority) intelligence in the area of Nur Shams,"" the IDF said in a statement. During the raid, which began Friday, ""the forces eliminated 14 terrorists in close-quarters combat, apprehended 15 wanted suspects, seized numerous weapons, and destroyed dozens of explosive devices as well as two terror explosives laboratories,"" according to the IDF statement. The IDF said all of the terrorists were killed during fire exchanges with Israeli forces. Since the raid started, nine IDF soldiers and an Israel Border Police officer were ""lightly to moderately"" injured in the fighting, according to the IDF. The Palestine Red Crescent Society, the first responder service in the West Bank, also said 14 people were killed as a result of the raid. -ABC News' Victoria Beaule U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the department will be announcing his determinations regarding the Israel Defense Forces under the Leahy Law -- which empowers the secretary of state to withhold funding from units of a foreign military accused of human rights violations -- ""in the coming days.""

Harvey Weinsteinâs rape conviction from landmark #MeToo trial overturned,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. New York’s highest court has overturned Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction, finding the judge at the landmark #MeToo trial prejudiced the ex-movie mogul with “egregious” improper rulings, including a decision to let women testify about allegations that weren’t part of the case. NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s highest court on Thursday threw out Harvey Weinstein ’s 2020 rape conviction with a ruling that shocked and disappointed women who celebrated historic gains during the #MeToo era and left those who testified in the case bracing for a retrial against the ex-movie mogul. The court found the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren’t part of the case. Weinstein, 72, will remain in prison because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. But the New York ruling reopens a painful chapter in America’s reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures — an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein. #MeToo advocates noted that Thursday’s ruling was based on legal technicalities and not an exoneration of Weinstein’s behavior, saying the original trial irrevocably moved the cultural needle on attitudes about sexual assault. The Manhattan district attorney’s office said it intends to retry Weinstein, and at least one of his accusers said through her lawyer that she would testify again. The state Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein’s 23-year sentence in a 4-3 decision, saying “the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts” and permitted questions about Weinstein’s “bad behavior” if he had testified. It called this “highly prejudicial” and “an abuse of judicial discretion.” In a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the Court of Appeals was continuing a “disturbing trend of overturning juries’ guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.” She said the ruling came at “the expense and safety of women.” In another dissent, Judge Anthony Cannataro wrote that the decision was “endangering decades of progress in this incredibly complex and nuanced area of law” regarding sex crimes after centuries of “deeply patriarchal and misogynistic legal tradition.” The reversal of Weinstein’s conviction is the second major #MeToo setback in the last two years. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of a Pennsylvania court decision to throw out Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction. Weinstein has been in a New York prison since his conviction for forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006, and rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actor in 2013. He was acquitted on the most serious charges — two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in the Los Angeles case. AP correspondent Margie Szaroleta reports what happens next after movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s New York rape conviction was dismissed. Weinstein’s lawyers expect Thursday’s ruling to have a major impact on the appeal of his Los Angeles rape conviction. Their arguments are due May 20. Jennifer Bonjean, a Weinstein attorney, said the California prosecution also relied on evidence of uncharged conduct alleged against him. “A jury was told in California that he was convicted in another state for rape,” Bonjean said. “Turns out he shouldn’t have been convicted and it wasn’t a fair conviction. … It interfered with his presumption of innocence in a significant way in California.” Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala called the Court of Appeals ruling “a tremendous victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York.” FILE - Harvey Weinstein arrives at the courthouse during jury deliberations in his rape trial, Monday, Feb. 24, 2020, in New York.

Wigdor, who has represented eight Harvey Weinstein accusers including two witnesses at the New York criminal trial, called it “a major step back” and contrary to routine rulings by judges allowing evidence of uncharged acts to help jurors understand the intent or patterns of a defendant’s criminal behavior. Debra Katz, a prominent civil rights and #MeToo attorney who represented several Weinstein accusers, said her clients are “feeling gutted” by the ruling, but she believes — and is telling them — that their testimony had changed the world. “People continue to come forward, people continue to support other victims who’ve reported sexual assault and violence, and I truly believe there’s no going back from...",15 hours ago,1
Key moments from landmark Supreme Court arguments on Trump's immunity claims,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Supreme Court seems highly skeptical of former President Donald Trump’s claim of absolute immunity from prosecution. WASHINGTON (AP) — There was talk of drone strikes and presidential bribes, of a potential ruling “for the ages” and of the Founding Fathers, too. The presidential race went unmentioned but was not far from mind. The Supreme Court heard more than 2 1/2 hours worth of arguments on the landmark question of whether former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Though the justices appeared likely to reject Trump’s absolute immunity claim, it seemed possible he could still benefit from a lengthy trial delay, possibly beyond November’s election. A look at some of the many notable moments: Justice Neil Gorsuch conveyed concern that prosecutors, or political opponents, could have bad motives in pursuing political rivals. Michael Dreeben, a lawyer for special counsel Jack Smith’s team, responded that this fear was inapplicable in this case. “I appreciate that,” Gorsuch said. “But you also appreciate that we’re writing a rule for the ages.” Other justices were no less lofty in describing the historic stakes of the case and the potential for precedent that will stand the test of time far beyond Trump. For conservative justices, that approach seemed a way to set aside the facts of the Trump indictment and the brazen abuse of power it alleges and focus instead on the implication of a court ruling on cases that have yet to be charged — but theoretically could be. “This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country, in my view,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee who served in the George W. Bush White House and is generally seen as a staunch protector of presidential power. All in all, the court seemed more interested in the future than the present as it contemplated the ruling ahead. There were plenty of historic callbacks, too, with frequent invocations of the nation’s Founding Fathers. There was no reference in the arguments to “November.” Nor to “2024.” Even Trump’s name was barely uttered, and mostly in the context of the formal title of court cases. Yet there’s no question that the 2024 election was the proverbial elephant in the room, and in that sense, the words not spoken were almost as loud as those that were. Hovering in the background of Thursday’s session was the tacit acknowledgment that the court is helping decide not only whether Trump is immune from prosecution but also whether he can stand trial before the vote. The uncomfortable reality for an institution loath to be thought of as a political actor is that a decision that takes until late June or early July to write, or that directs a lower court to do additional analysis about which acts Trump could conceivably be entitled to immunity for, could delay the trial until after the election. Dreeben took care not to note the consequences of the court’s ruling on the election or to urge a speedy ruling for political purposes. The closest, albeit still oblique, reference to the election came from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who at one point said to Dreeben: “The special counsel has expressed some concern for speed and wanting to move forward.” While the court seemed highly skeptical of Trump’s bid to dismiss the case, several justices suggested it may have to be sent back for more legal wrangling before the case could go to trial. Such a ruling would almost certainly delay the trial until after the election. That would be a victory for Trump because, if he defeats President Joe Biden in November, he could presumably order his new attorney general to dismiss the case, or issue a pardon for himself. Barrett and others repeatedly tried to pin down Trump’s lawyer and Smith’s team on whether the acts alleged in the indictment were official acts — and, therefore, potentially shielded from prosecution — versus private acts. And even as Chief Justice John Roberts made clear his resistance to Trump’s sweeping absolute immunity claims, he also said he had “concerns” about an earlier appeals court ruling that rejected Trump’s immunity arguments but that did not provide a detailed analysis of whether the acts in the indictment were official or private ones. The lower court, Roberts said, appears to be saying simply that “a former president...",13 hours ago,1
Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction overturned by New York appeals court,"Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction was overturned Thursday in New York, making way for a new trial. The state Court of Appeals found that the judge in the landmark #MeToo trial prejudiced Weinstein, the former film mogul, with improper rulings, including a decision to let women testify about allegations that weren’t part of the case. “We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose,” the court said in a 4-3 decision. “The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light,” it said. Judge Jenny Rivera called the errors “egregious” and said the remedy is a new trial. Weinstein's accusers could again be called to testify if prosecutors decide to pursue another trial. Judge Madeline Singas, in a dissenting opinion, accused the majority of “whitewashing the facts to conform to a he-said/she-said narrative” and failing to recognize that the jury was allowed to consider Weinstein’s past assaults. “This Court has continued a disturbing trend of overturning juries’ guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence,” Singas wrote. In a separate dissenting opinion, Judge Anthony Cannataro said the decision was an “unfortunate step backwards.” Louise Godbold, who used to work in commercial production and has alleged that Weinstein attacked her twice in 1991, told NBC News that her first reaction to the ruling was ""a visceral one."" ""Texting with other survivors, we’re all saying ‘our hands were shaking so much,'"" she said Thursday. ""All of the fear and the panic and the confusion from the original trauma comes back, and before you even have time to compose a thought, it’s your body that’s reacting."" Caitlin Dulany, an actor who has said Weinstein sexually assaulted her in a hotel room during the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, said she is ""deeply shocked"" and ""saddened."" ""I think I'm still in a little shock,"" she told NBC News. “I think later on a lot of the deep sadness will come through."" Filipina Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who accused Weinstein of groping her and captured him on tape saying, “I won’t do it again,” said the decision highlighted ongoing failures of the justice system and the courts. Former actor and Weinstein accuser Dawn Dunning slammed the decision. ""While I’m stunned that the court threw out Weinstein’s conviction on legal technicalities, I am still proud that I testified and confronted that convicted rapist,"" Dunning said in a statement. An attorney for Alexandra Canosa, a producer who has accused Weinstein of rape, said: “Today’s decision by the New York State Court of Appeals is very disappointing. Weinstein is a serial sexual predator and has been found guilty of being one by juries in two separate states.” Attorney Lindsay Goldbrum, who represented six Weinstein accusers, called the decision a ""leap backward for the rule of law"" that could deter future sexual assault victims from coming forward. “To all victims of sexual assault who are retraumatized by today’s ruling, I am so sorry,"" said Goldbrum, whose clients included model Tarale Wulff, who testified that Weinstein raped her at his Manhattan apartment in 2005 after having lured her there with talk of a movie audition. Douglas H. Wigdor, an attorney who has represented eight Weinstein accusers, also slammed the decision and said it ""is a major step back in holding those accountable for acts of sexual violence."" ""Courts routinely admit evidence of other uncharged acts where they assist juries in understanding issues concerning the intent, modus operandi or scheme of the defendant,"" he said in a statement. Wigdor said overturning the conviction was ""tragic in that it will require the victims to endure yet another trial."" Dulany said she hopes prosecutors will continue to pursue the case. A spokesperson for the Manhattan district attorney’s office said it “will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault.” Godbold expressed concern that the accusers could have to relive their trauma. “It was definitely re-traumatizing for them to have to go through the trial,"" she said. ""And for any of them to have to go back on the witness stand … it’s just...",21 hours ago,1

USC cancels main commencement over Gaza war protests,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Los Angeles Police Department said more than 90 people were arrested Wednesday during a day of Gaza War protests at the University of Southern California. The University of Southern California canceled its main graduation ceremony and dozens more college students were arrested at other campuses nationwide Thursday as protests against the Israel-Hamas war continued to spread. College officials across the U.S. are worried the ongoing protests could disrupt plans for commencement ceremonies next month. Some universities have called in police to break up the demonstrations, resulting in ugly scuffles and hundreds of arrests, while others appeared content to wait out student protests as the final days of the semester ticked down. Schools such as Columbia University in New York continued to negotiate with protesters who first set up an encampment last week. At California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, faculty members met with students who have barricaded themselves inside a campus building since Monday, trying to negotiate a solution. The campus was shut down earlier this week with classes moved online. Other universities are rewriting their rules to ban encampments and moving final exams to new locations. But encampments and protests continued to spring up Thursday. At Indiana University Bloomington, a tent encampment popped up before police with shields and batons shoved into a line of protesters, arresting 33 people. At the City College of New York, hundreds of students who were gathered on the lawn beneath the Harlem campus’ famed gothic buildings erupted in cheers after a small contingent of police officers retreated from the scene. In one corner of the quad, a “security training” was held among students. Police arrested one protester and tore down tents at the University of Connecticut Thursday, while demonstrators at Stanford University rallied on a day when newly admitted students visited the campus.

Hong) Students protesting the war are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling the conflict. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus. USC announced the cancellation of the May 10 graduation ceremony a day after more than 90 protesters were arrested on campus. The university said it will still host dozens of commencement events, including all the traditional individual school commencement ceremonies. Tensions were already high after USC canceled a planned commencement speech by the school’s pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns. “We understand that this is disappointing; however, we are adding many new activities and celebrations to make this commencement academically meaningful, memorable, and uniquely USC,” the university said in a statement Thursday. The Los Angeles Police Department said 93 people were arrested Wednesday night during a campus protest for allegedly trespassing. One person was arrested on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon. At Emerson College in Boston, 108 people were arrested overnight at an alleyway encampment. Video shows police first warning students in the alleyway to leave. Students linked arms to resist officers, who moved forcefully through the crowd and threw some protesters to the ground. “As the night progressed, it got tenser and tenser. There were just more cops on all sides. It felt like we were being slowly pushed in and crushed,” said Ocean Muir, a sophomore.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Muir said police lifted her by her arms and legs and carried her away. Along with other students, Muir was charged Thursday with trespassing and disorderly conduct. Emerson College leaders had warned students that the alley was a public right-of-way and city authorities had threatened to take action if the protesters didn’t leave. Emerson canceled classes Thursday, and Boston police said four officers suffered injuries that were not life-threatening during the confrontation. The University of Texas at Austin campus was much calmer Thursday after 55 people were arrested a day earlier — 26 of whom had no affiliation with the university, according to a statement to the campus by university president Jay Hartzell. University officials pulled back barricades and allowed demonstrators onto the main square beneath the school’s iconic clock tower. Thursday’s gathering of students and some faculty protested both the war and Wednesday’s arrests, when...",12 hours ago,1
"NFL draft 2024 first round picks selected as Caleb Williams gets No. 1 
spot: Highlights","Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time The Chicago Bears selected Southern California quarterback Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft Thursday in Detroit. He was followed by the Washington Commanders’ selection of LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels and the New England Patriots’ choice of North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye. Six quarterbacks — Williams, Daniels, Maye, J.J. McCarthy, Michael Penix Jr. and Bo Nix — were taken in the first 12 picks. In total, 23 offensive players heard their names called, the most in NFL draft history. Williams, the consensus top prospect, threw for 3,633 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions last season. He won the Heisman Trophy as the best player in college football the previous season after he took the Trojans from a four-win team to an 11-win team. Williams threw for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and only four interceptions over 13 games in 2022. The Bears were able to select Williams thanks to a major trade ahead of the 2023 draft. Chicago — which owned the No. 1 pick at the time — sent it to the Carolina Panthers in return for receiver DJ Moore, 2023 first- and second-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick and a 2025 second-round pick. That 2024 first-round pick would later become the No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft. Williams joins a retooled Chicago team that traded for six-time Pro Bowl receiver Keenan Allen and signed running back D’Andre Swift this offseason. The Bears also have rising stars in Moore and tight end Cole Kmet. The Commanders selected LSU star Daniels at No. 2. The 6-foot-4, 210-pound quarterback won the 2023 Heisman Trophy after one of the most electrifying seasons in college football history. He threw for 3,812 yards, 40 touchdowns and only four interceptions while adding 1,134 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground. Maye was selected No. 3 by the Patriots. At 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, he boasts the prototypical size for the position and has drawn comparisons to Los Angeles Chargers signal-caller Justin Herbert. Maye — the 2022 ACC Rookie of the Year and ACC Player of the Year as a sophomore — threw for 3,608 yards, 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions last season in his junior year. The biggest shock came at No. 8, when Michael Penix Jr. was selected by the Atlanta Falcons. Not only was that higher than most had expected the Washington quarterback to be taken, it also came from a team that signed veteran signal-caller Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract with $100 million guaranteed this offseason. “It was a big surprise. We had no idea this was coming,” Cousins’ agent, Mike McCartney, said in a text to the NFL Network. “The truth is the whole league had no idea this was coming. We got no heads up. Kirk got a call from the Falcons when they were on the clock. That was the first we heard. It never came up in any conversation.” NBC News Mike Florio breaks down how the addition of wide receiver Rome Odunze on top of QB Caleb Williams will transform Chicago's offense. Greg Rosenstein The quick South Carolina receiver had 71 receptions for 1,255 yards and seven touchdowns last season. He will be a major boost for Bryce Young, who had few weapons to throw to in his rookie season. Greg Rosenstein The former Arizona State and Florida receiver is a speedster, running a 4.2 40-yard dash. What could this mean for Deebo Samuel or Brandon Aiyuk? Connor Rogers, NBC Sports Few corners move or run like Wiggins can. The No. 30 pick needs to fill out his frame, but keep in mind he won’t turn 21 until the end of his first NFL training camp. Connor Rogers, NBC Sports Guyton is built like a small forward and moves like a tight end. He started only one year (at right tackle) for Oklahoma, and his hand placement needs work, but he’s the type of athlete and has the body type you bet on at the position.

"'Best deal for us' | Why Bills GM Brandon Beane prioritized value in his 
decision to trade out of the first round","Contributing Correspondent The Buffalo Bills ended the opening night of the 2024 NFL Draft without making any additions to their roster, but general manager Brandon Beane remains confident in both the talent and value available as the Bills look to open the second day of action with the first pick of the second round. The Bills traded the 28th overall pick to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for the 32nd overall pick, which they subsequently traded to the Carolina Panthers. They received the 33rd overall pick, a third-round pick (95th overall) and jumped 59 spots into the fifth round from the sixth round. They also advanced 27 spots in the seventh round. ""We were, just like every year, following the board and where we think the value is,"" Beane said. ""We came into this draft without a [third round pick] and we're able to get ourselves back into the third and feel like there'll be some value there at this point."" Reporters asked Beane if he had any hesitation on making a deal with the Chiefs, who defeated Buffalo in the Divisional Round of the playoffs last season. ""No, because they can move around,"" Beane said. ""If we don't trade with them, someone else can to get whatever player they're targeting. To me, it's got to make sense for us and we'll follow our board. ""I would say that was the best deal for us. Take them out, take the team out of it, that was the best deal that we thought that fit what we want to do."" Beane did not rule out making more moves tomorrow, as fans have come to expect with the Bills general manager. ""I think we were just looking at it as moving up 59 slots in the draft giving us just more ammo to move around tomorrow,"" Beane said. ""And, you know, we'll get a lot of calls for this pick tomorrow at 33, our phones already ringing so we'll see what happens."" Beane made it clear that he trusts the draft grades he and his scouting team have worked on and emphasized the importance of value when making the decision to use or trade a draft pick. ""We weren't near 28 first round grades so you know going in, there's not necessarily a great chance that you're going to pick there,"" Beane said. ""We put a lot of time in the [draft] board and one of the things we said was, if there's an opportunity to get back into the third, we do believe there will be some value or at least a value of that pick, again, if we want to move around."" With the first pick in the second round, the Bills will have plenty of time to listen to trade offers as the team that is now on the clock. Until then, Beane and his staff will weigh the decision to move back or choose from the available talent. ""It puts us on the pole position for tomorrow,"" Beane said. ""And we'll see. We've have some calls, I think we'll get more calls. And if it makes too much sense to move back again and pick up something else, we would do that. We also think there's a couple of good players to choose from."" Scroll to see the photos from inside the Bills draft room during Thursday's first round.

"Capital News Service and VCU InSight, two powerful proving grounds for 
journalism students, reach notable milestones","Sections April 25, 2024 By Sian Wilkerson For decades, Virginia Commonwealth University’s journalism students have taken on the mantle of local and state news coverage, reporting on real issues for real readers. Now, as the award-winning Capital News Service and VCU InSight programs celebrate important milestones, educators are more focused than ever on introducing budding reporters to the realities of the industry. CNS, which began in 1994 to cover the General Assembly, is a student wire service that produces stories – about 40 per semester – for more than 100 news outlets throughout Virginia. In 2019, the program, which is now in its 30th year, was expanded to include a fall semester in addition to the traditional spring classes. InSight, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, was launched in 2003 as a 30-minute TV news show produced by undergraduate students. Newscasts air regularly on the program’s YouTube channel, covering stories from around the city and in nearby counties. Students take the lead on everything from writing and editing to directing and reporting. In addition to the weekly newscast, students also turn out longer-form stories and packages. “If your story goes through the news wire, it’s going to be published on anywhere from five to 20 different news sites, and sometimes more,” said Alix Bryan-Campos, an assistant professor and director of Capital News Service. “It’s going to be read by politicians, it’s going to be read by nonprofits, it’s going to be read by other journalists and people in the community. That’s an experience level a lot of people don’t get until grad school or until they start their job.” Bryan-Campos and Ashley Poerstel, an instructor and director of VCU InSight, are two educators in the Richard T. Robertson School of Media and Culture in the College of Humanities and Sciences teaching journalism’s next generation. Before coming to VCU, Bryan-Campos and Poerstel began their careers as multimedia journalists, giving them a unique perspective as they guide students toward their eventual careers. “We bring a lot of our own working experiences into how we teach,” Poerstel said. “That’s an element for our students that you don’t always see in the academic world. [On one hand] we understand that [students] need to get the story, have great storytelling and have great writing. But we also understand what these students are going through when it’s frustrating trying to get someone to talk to you or if you hit a wall and you’re not sure which direction you should go with a story.” Last year, CNS and InSight joined forces to start a newsroom concept that helps to facilitate more frequent collaboration between student broadcast and digital reporters. The students now have the opportunity to work together on semester-long projects, with one CNS student pairing up with an InSight student to cover a topic that relates to Virginians. “These two capstone classes used to do their own thing and they were very focused on that type of [separate] production,” Bryan-Campos said. “But news doesn't really operate in that type of silo anymore. In that vein, reporters who are up and coming need to be more familiar with multi-platform reporting.” Both programs have become a proving ground unlike what most journalism students experience as undergraduates. Mass communications major Emily Richardson called her time with CNS “integral to my development as a journalist and a highlight of my VCU career.” Richardson, who graduates in May, will continue to pursue journalism this summer as she joins Carnegie-Knight News21, a national reporting initiative headquartered at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, armed with the tools she learned with CNS. “[Writing for CNS] was a chance to hone the hard skills like writing, interviewing and putting together data visualizations,” she said. While covering government and policy, she explained complicated information in a digestible way and collaborated with her fellow journalism students. She said those skills position her for success throughout her career. During her time with InSight, mass communications major Brigette Kelly learned to be a reporter in a working newsroom, adhering to tight deadlines and getting comfortable in front of the camera, which she knows will be critical as she embarks on a career in broadcast journalism. Following graduation in May, Kelly will begin a new job at WSET-ABC13, a Lynchburg-based television station, where she will pitch, shoot, write and edit her own stories as a “one-man band.” She credits InSight with helping her prepare for the task.

The latest national NBC News poll finds the third-party vote — and especially independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — cutting deeper into former President Donald Trump’s support than President Joe Biden’s, though the movement the other candidates create is within the poll’s margin of error.
Trump leads Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44%, in the new NBC News poll.
Yet when the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden is the one with a 2-point advantage: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.
The big reason is that the poll finds a greater share of Trump voters in the head-to-head matchup backing Kennedy in the expanded ballot. Fifteen percent of respondents who picked Trump the first time pick Kennedy in the five-way ballot, compared with 7% of those who initially picked Biden.
In addition, Republican voters view Kennedy much more favorably (40% positive, 15% negative) than Democratic voters do (16% positive, 53% negative).
“At this stage, [Kennedy’s] appeal looks to be more with Trump than Biden voters,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted the NBC News poll with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.
That finding, however, contrasts with the conventional political wisdom — as well as the results of other national polls — suggesting that a bigger third-party vote hurts Biden more.
The NBC News poll results on Kennedy’s impact are “different than other surveys,” said McInturff, the GOP pollster. “So there’s always two possibilities: One, it’s an outlier. … Or two, we’re going to be seeing more of this, and our survey is a harbinger of what’s to come.”
The Biden campaign has actively tried to peel support away from Kennedy. Most recently, Biden held an event Thursday with members of the Kennedy family who are endorsing him over their relative.
Overall, the party is paying much closer attention to Kennedy than it has to past third-party candidates, mobilizing new super PACs and an arm of the Democratic National Committee focused on reducing the pull of his candidacy.
The NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cellphone — was conducted April 12-16 and has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.

How one state is trying to make weight loss drugs cheaper,"Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Dale Folwell says North Carolina is “under siege” by drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The North Carolina treasurer said the sky-high costs of popular weight loss drugs — Wegovy and Saxenda, from Novo Nordisk, and Zepbound, from Eli Lilly — have financially strained the state’s health insurance plan for its more than 750,000 teachers, state employees and retirees, forcing it to stop providing coverage for the drugs earlier this year. According to the state treasurer’s office, last year, North Carolina paid for weight loss drugs for almost 25,000 state employees, costing it more than $100 million — about 10% of its total spending on prescription drugs and more than the plan spent on all cancer treatments combined. The weight loss drugs were projected to cost North Carolina another $600 million-plus within the next five years. That ballooning expense prompted the state’s health plan board of trustees in January to vote to stop covering them on the state’s health care plan. That’s not how Folwell wanted it to go. Last fall, in a last-ditch effort to reduce the state’s spending on weight loss drugs, Folwell, working alongside the state’s pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark, initiated drug pricing negotiations with Novo Nordisk, later followed by Eli Lilly. The negotiations are ongoing. “I don’t recall of any time since I’ve been the keeper of the public purse in the last eight years where we’ve tried to have direct conversations with the manufacturers of any drugs,” he said. Novo Nordisk charges a monthly list price of around $1,350 each for Wegovy and Saxenda, while Lilly charges about $1,060 a month for Zepbound. North Carolina gets a rebate from the drugmakers that lowers those prices by a few hundred dollars; even so, the state says the drugs are too expensive for it to afford. “The cost of this drug can be anywhere from $10 to $70 to manufacture it, and it’s being sold for retail for well over $1,000,” Folwell said. “I don’t know what word in the Webster’s Dictionary would best describe it other than being gouged.” Folwell is also proposing that the state health plan raise the minimum body mass index, or BMI, threshold to qualify for the drugs, reserving it for people with severe obesity. The Food and Drug Administration approved the medications for patients with a BMI of 30 or above, which is characterized as obesity, not severe obesity. He also wants to limit the amount of time people can stay on the drugs if they aren't effective. Folwell is coming to the negotiating table with one number in mind: $300. That’s around the price, he said, that people pay in Denmark, where Novo Nordisk is based. “When we’re being gouged on the price of this drug versus what it costs in the home country of where this company is headquartered, we have to take action,” he said. In separate statements, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly said that they are committed to working on potential solutions to provide coverage to North Carolina patients. But Nicole Ferreira, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson, said in the company’s statement that the state “rejected multiple, workable options presented to them.” “Denying patients insurance coverage for important and effective FDA-approved treatments is simply irresponsible,” she said. If the state had continued to cover the drugs under the current deal, monthly premiums for all state employees on the plan would’ve likely doubled, Folwell said. Depending on their plan, people typically pay a monthly premium of $25 or $50. Ferreira said, “we stand committed to finding meaningful solutions to manage costs.” In a statement, an Eli Lilly spokesperson said, “We remain committed to expanding access and are continuing to explore different approaches with PBMs, health plans, and employers,” referring to pharmacy benefit managers, which act as a middleman between drugmakers and insurers. “We remain cautiously optimistic that ongoing negotiations with CVS Caremark and the drug manufacturers will result in affordable costs of these medications,” a spokesperson for the state treasurer’s office said. North Carolina isn’t the only state plan that has covered weight loss drugs and was forced to make a change. Connecticut recently limited the weight loss drugs to state employees who also agreed to follow lifestyle, diet and exercise changes, a move that Sean Scanlon, the state’s comptroller, said has helped lower costs. Asked about negotiating with the drugmakers, Scanlon said he’s watching what’s happening in other states....",1 day ago,1

Bears release plans for stadium project in Chicago,"Senior Writer During a public presentation Wednesday at Soldier Field, the Bears unveiled their plans to build a state-of-the-art fixed-roof stadium along Chicago's lakefront. The Burnham Park Project includes a new publicly-owned multipurpose replacement stadium located just south of Soldier Field that's part of a singular year-round hub centered on park-based culture and recreation. ""This is an incredibly, incredibly special day for the Chicago Bears,"" said Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren, ""for the City of Chicago, for the state of Illinois, for our ownership, for our players, for our coaches, for our staff members, for the alumni and for our incredible Chicago Bear fans. ""Today is about progress, and one of the things that I am most excited about today is the fact that this shows that in this city we have the intellectual capabilities, we have the heart, we have the passion, we have the foresight, we have the wisdom, we have the vision to do big things."" The proposal boasts year-round use for recreational and community events and an increase in open and green space, including 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space for use by public and youth sports programs. The athletic fields would provide a high-quality, safe place for the city's youth, especially those from nearby underserved neighborhoods, to gather and play sports. Visitors would be able to enjoy the lakefront via indoor and outdoor experiences. The plan features a three-acre promenade and plaza area which could include year-round food and beverage outlets, retail shops, a cultural attraction focused on sports and Soldier Field history. A publicly-owned hotel could also be included on the recreation and cultural campus. The new stadium would continue the tradition on a site that has hosted Chicago's major civic, entertainment, sports and cultural events for 100 years. ""The Bears have been proud to call Chicago home for more than 100 years,"" said Bears chairman George H. McCaskey. ""Perhaps no other sports team embodies the character of the city it represents better than the Bears and Chicago. Our founder, George Halas, emphasized the importance of being a champion for Chicago. This has been part of the foundation of our organization. That is why we are excited to invest in the greatest city in the world through a stadium project and site improvements that will benefit Chicagoans and visitors."" The proposal includes a contemporary architectural design which complements the existing architecture featuring an enclosed, fixed roof; spectacular views of Chicago's skyline and lakefront; intimate seating for unparalleled sight lines and open spaces for congregating. The stadium would be capable of hosting large-scale sporting events year-round, including Super Bowls and NCAA Final Fours as well as the world's most prominent entertainment acts. Those spectacles would unlock economic benefits for a variety of sectors within Chicago and the region, evidenced in part by the estimated $6.6 billion in direct fiscal tax impact produced nationwide in 2021 by the sports tourism sector of the economy, according to Sports Business Journal. Recent Super Bowls have reportedly generated $1.3 billion for Arizona in 2023, $234-478 million for Los Angeles County in 2022 and $572 million for South Florida in 2020. Recent Final Fours have produced $270 million for Houston in 2023, $106 million for Louisiana in 2022 and $80-100 million for Indianapolis in 2021. ""This is a beautiful day for the City of Chicago,"" said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. ""It really is, and as a lifelong Bears fan, it is an honor to be here to celebrate the Bears' commitment to remaining the *Chicago *Bears. This is going to reinvigorate the entire City of Chicago. It would be the crown jewel of the City of Chicago, and with this new project we are showing the world what Chicago is capable of."" Other project benefits include a pedestrian mall and pavilion, a wider variety of food and beverage options, more public restrooms, and the preservation of Soldier Field's historic colonnades, which will remain accessible to fans and continue to honor the men and women who served in our nation's military. The Bears have pledged to contribute more than $2 billion to the project—over 70% of the total stadium cost. The remaining stadium funds are proposed to come from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA), a government entity that was created by the Illinois General Assembly in 1987 for the purpose of constructing and renovating sports stadiums for professional teams in the state of Illinois. The Bears' proposal can be accomplished with the existing 2% hotel tax...",1 day ago,1
Supreme Court divided over access to emergency abortions,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Dueling protests were taking place outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington. The court was hearing arguments Wednesday over whether state abortion bans enacted after its sweeping ruling overturning Roe v. Wade can extend to medical emergencies. (AP video: Rick Gentilo, Dan Huff) Follow the AP’s live coverage of arguments in the Supreme Court WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservative Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical Wednesday that state abortion bans enacted after the overturning of Roe v. Wade violate federal health care law, though some also questioned the effects on emergency care for pregnant patients. The case marks the first time the Supreme Court has considered the implications of a state ban since overturning the nationwide right to abortion. It comes from Idaho, which is among 14 states that now ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with very limited exceptions. The high court has already allowed the state ban to go into effect, even in medical emergencies, and it was unclear whether members of the conservative majority were swayed by the Biden administration’s argument that federal law overrides the state in rare emergency cases where a pregnant patient’s health is at serious risk. The closely watched case tests how open the court is to carving out limited exceptions to state abortion bans. Their ruling, expected by late June, will also affect a similar case in Texas and could have wide implications amid a spike in complaints that pregnant women have been turned away from emergency rooms care since Roe was overturned. The Biden administration says abortion care must be allowed in those cases under a law that requires hospitals accepting Medicare to provide emergency care regardless of patients’ ability to pay. Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the decision overturning Roe v. Wade, was doubtful. “How can you impose restrictions on what Idaho can criminalize, simply because hospitals in Idaho have chosen to participate in Medicare?” Alito said. Idaho contends its ban does have exceptions for life-saving abortions, and the administration wants to wrongly expand the times when it’s allowed to turn hospitals into “abortion enclaves.” But liberal justices detailed cases of pregnant women hemorrhaging or having to undergo hysterectomies after abortion care was denied or delayed in states with bans. “Within these rare cases, there’s a significant number where the woman’s life is not in peril, but she’s going to lose her reproductive organs. She’s going to lose the ability to have children in the future unless an abortion takes place,” said Justice Elena Kagan. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, said she was “kind of shocked” that an attorney for Idaho appeared to hedge when asked whether the state would allow abortions in cases like those. Attorney Joshua N. Turner responded that doctors can use their “good faith” medical judgment under Idaho’s life-saving exception, but Barrett continued to press: “What if the prosecutor thinks differently?” Turner acknowledged that a doctor could face a criminal case in that situation. Performing an abortion outside of limited exceptions in Idaho is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since Roe was overturned, and Turner said those laws all have narrower exceptions than the federal law. “This isn’t going to end with Idaho. This question is going to come up in state after state,” he said. Doctors have said Idaho’s abortion ban has already affected emergency care. More women whose conditions are typically treated with abortions must now be flown out of state for care, since doctors must wait until they are close to death to provide terminations within the bounds of state law. Abortion opponents say doctors have mishandled maternal emergency cases, and argue the Biden administration overstates health care woes to undermine state abortion laws. The justices also heard another abortion case this term seeking to restrict access to abortion medication. It remains pending, though the justices overall seemed skeptical of the push. The Justice Department originally brought the case against Idaho, arguing the state’s abortion law conflicts with the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, known as EMTALA. It requires hospitals that accept Medicare to provide emergency care to any patient regardless of their ability to pay. Nearly all hospitals accept Medicare. A federal judge initially sided with the administration and ruled that abortions were legal in medical emergencies. After the state appealed, the Supreme Court allowed the law to go fully into effect in January. The audience...",1 day ago,1

Final Mock Drafts: What analysts think Bears will do with No. 9 pick,"Senior Writer With the start of the NFL Draft just a few hours away, several analysts have updated their mock drafts. While all of them are predicting that the Bears will select USC quarterback Caleb Williams at No. 1, here's what they think they'll do at No. 9: Brad Biggs, Chicago Tribune (April 23) No. 9 pick: Washington receiver Rome Odunze Comment: This feels like a spot where the Bears will either grab Odunze, who had a super-productive career at Washington, or select Murphy. One of them likely will be available if Poles passes on a trade-down scenario. Odunze could quickly emerge as a future star with Caleb Williams. Bucky Brooks, NFL.com (April 23) No. 9 pick: Washington receiver Rome Odunze Comment: As a physical playmaker with a high IQ and positional flexibility, Odunze is a perfect complement to veteran studs DJ Moore and Keenan Allen in the receiving corps. Caleb Williams has quite the arsenal to work with. Dane Brugler, The Athletic (April 25) No. 9 pick: Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II Comment: If the top three receivers come off the board in the first eight picks, the Bears would become much more of a wild card at No. 9. Murphy might not have desired size, but he'd be a scheme fit, and he's consistently disruptive versus pass and run. Courtney Cronin, ESPN (April 23) No. 9 pick: Washington receiver Rome Odunze Comment: Bears general manager Ryan Poles continues to add to the offense with Odunze, a receiver who might have been the first off the board in drafts that didn't feature so much talent at wideout. Adding the big-bodied receiver to a position group that already boasts DJ Moore and Keenan Allen gives the Bears an unquestioned top-five trio for Williams' rookie season. Charles Davis, NFL.com (April 24) No. 9 pick: Alabama defensive end Dallas Turner Comment: Head coach Matt Eberflus needs someone to help the sensational Montez Sweat get after the QB for this team on the rise. Nate Davis, USA Today (April 23) No. 9 pick: Washington receiver Rome Odunze Comment: Trading down could be temping for Chicago, which has a draft-low four selections, as well. Yet the Bears, who have been busily building a proper supporting cast for Williams, are also dangerously thin at wideout behind DJ Moore and Keenan Allen. Spectacular as Harrison and Nabers are, plenty of proponents for Odunze, an All-American last year and All-Pac-12 member the past two. The 6-3, 212-pounder has a sterling off-field reputation plus the ball skills and production (92 catches, for 1,640 yards, 13 TDs in 2023) to be a co-WR1 with Moore in 2025 and beyond. Eric Edholm, NFL.com (April 22) No. 9 pick: Bears trade down to No. 15 and take Alabama defensive end Dallas Turner Comment: Sliding back six spots and picking up another Day 2 pick here, the Bears would land a player who probably would have been on the table at No. 9. Turner would be a good complement to Montez Sweat and give Chicago a boost to the pass rush. Josh Edwards, CBS Sports (April 24) No. 9 pick: Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II Comment: Chicago took Gervon Dexter Sr. and Zacch Pickens a year ago, but Byron Murphy II would give it greater expectations for the position. The Bears defense took a large step forward last season but is now poised to take an even bigger step. Chris Emma, 670 The Score (April 25) No. 9 pick: Washington receiver Rome Odunze Patrick Finley, Chicago Sun-Times (April 25) No. 9 pick: Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II Comment: I love the top three receivers in this draft — Marvin Harrison is the player most likely to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Odunze is a great fit with the Bears and LSU's Malik Nabers is more physically gifted than either of them. The problem: all three will be gone when the Bears pick ninth. Presuming the top eight picks are four quarterbacks, three receivers and Alt — in some order — Poles would be well-served to trade down. Perhaps the Raiders or Broncos would be willing to pay a hefty ransom to move up and take quarterback Michael Penix. Kevin Fishbain, The Athletic (April 22) No. 9 pick: Bears trade down to No. 12 and take Penn State tackle Olu Fashanu Comment: Here's an opportunity to once again use a key draft resource and find (Darnell) Wright's bookend, giving Poles runway at one of the most important positions...",22 hours ago,1
"Eckerd College administration forms student advisory council to bridge the 
gap","Students gather in the Upham Administration building to chat with President Annarelli. Photo by Penh Alicandro ’22
Council members are from all areas of Eckerd’s campus, with representatives from Residence Life, the Eckerd College Organization of Students, the Culture Council, Religious Life, the Search and Rescue Team, and many others. Each month, one member of the council proposes a topic to discuss—such as accessibility, DEIB efforts or student-athlete relations.
The council’s main goal this academic year has been to lessen the distance between members of the administration and the student body. So far, the council has hosted several Cookies in Upham events in the Upham Administration building, where the president’s offices are located.
“We’ve been trying to make [Upham] feel more approachable and accessible for students, so it’s not so big and scary,” says council co-chair Aidan McKinnon, a senior marine science student from Edmond, Oklahoma.
The Advisory Council was formed two years ago when President James Annarelli, Ph.D., took the helm.
The president “wanted to hear from students themselves and have them at the table to problem-solve,” says Anne Wetmore ’94, chief of staff and secretary to the board. “We also wanted to connect students with staff on campus who can influence a variety of issues students are interested in.”
Council members do more, however, than liaise between students and administrators and advise Annarelli. Last year, they also had an opportunity to interview candidates for the vital staff position of vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty. “We did not hold back,” says Maddie Reifsteck, president of ECOS and a senior creative writing and marine science student from Portland, Oregon. “Something else that I think is an advantage of being on the council is that [President] Annarelli trusts us enough and trusts our opinions enough to [have wanted] us to be part of that search.” The position was filled by Christine Wooley, Ph.D., on Sept. 1, 2023.
In May, nine council members will graduate, leaving spaces open for new members to join, usually after being recommended by faculty or staff because of their leadership experience and interest in campus affairs. Making the connection between passionate students and members of the administration is a key part of the council, Maddie says, and can be mutually beneficial.
“The faculty and the executive officers that we’ve invited into that room have felt like students are showing an interest and engaging in a way that maybe they don’t always get to see,” Maddie adds. “Executive Staff and administration cares about students here and wants to hear their opinions, but also they’re seeing that there are students on campus who really care about the decisions that they are making.”

Dengue and severe dengue,"Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates. Most people who get dengue will not have symptoms. But for those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and rash. Most will get better in 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital. In severe cases, dengue can be fatal. You can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites especially during the day. Dengue is treated with pain medicine as there is no specific treatment currently. Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death. If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include: Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away: People with these severe symptoms should get care right away. After recovery, people who have had dengue may feel tired for several weeks. There is no specific treatment for dengue. The focus is on treating pain symptoms. Most cases of dengue fever can be treated at home with pain medicine. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is often used to control pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding. For people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often needed. The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades, with cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2019. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses (1). The highest number of dengue cases was recorded in 2023, affecting over 80 countries in all regions of WHO. Since the beginning of 2023 ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases, resulted in a historic high of over 6.5 million cases and more than 7300 dengue-related deaths reported. Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic: the changing distribution of the vectors (chiefly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes), especially in previously dengue naïve countries; the consequences of El Niño phenomena in 2023 and climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall and humidity; fragile health systems in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; and political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements. One modelling estimate indicates 390 million dengue virus infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically (2). Another study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue viruses (3). The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing around 70% of the global disease burden. Dengue is spreading to new areas in Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean and South America. The largest number of dengue cases reported was in 2023. The WHO Region of the Americas reported 4.5 million cases, with 2300 deaths. A high number of cases were reported in Asia: Bangladesh (321 000), Malaysia (111 400), Thailand (150 000), and Viet Nam (369 000). Transmission through the mosquito bite The dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Other species within the Aedes genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary to Aedes aegypti. However, in 2023, a surge in local transmission of dengue by Aedes albopictus (tiger mosquito) has been seen in Europe. After feeding on a infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8–12 days when the ambient temperature is between 25–28°C. Variations in the extrinsic incubation period are not only influenced by ambient temperature; several factors such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, virus genotype, and initial viral concentration can also alter the time it...",3 days ago,1

A rapidly spreading virus threatens the health of the cacao tree and the dried seeds from which chocolate is made, jeopardizing the global supply of the world’s most popular treat.

A rapidly spreading virus threatens the health of the cacao tree and the dried seeds from which chocolate is made, jeopardizing the global supply of the world’s most popular treat.
About 50% of the world’s chocolate originates from cacao trees in the West Africa countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana. The damaging virus is attacking cacao trees in Ghana, resulting in harvest losses of between 15 and 50%. Spread by small insects called mealybugs that eat the leaves, buds and flowers of trees, the cacao swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD) is among the most damaging threats to the root ingredient of chocolate.
“This virus is a real threat to the global supply of chocolate,” said Benito Chen-Charpentier, professor of mathematics at The University of Texas at Arlington and an author of “Cacao sustainability: The case of cacao swollen-shoot virus co-infection” in the journal PLoS One. “Pesticides don’t work well against mealybugs, leaving farmers to try to prevent the spread of the disease by cutting out infected trees and breeding resistant trees. But despite these efforts, Ghana has lost more than 254 million cacao trees in recent years.”
Farmers can combat the mealybugs by giving vaccines to the trees to inoculate them from the virus. But the vaccines are expensive, especially for low-wage farmers, and vaccinated trees produce a smaller harvest of cacao, compounding the devastation of the virus.

Healthy cacao tree
Chen-Charpentier and colleagues from the University of Kansas, Prairie View A&M, the University of South Florida and the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana have developed a new strategy: using mathematical data to determine how far apart farmers can plant vaccinated trees to prevent mealybugs from jumping from one tree to another and spreading the virus.

Chen-Charpentier and colleagues from the University of Kansas, Prairie View A&M, the University of South Florida and the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana have developed a new strategy: using mathematical data to determine how far apart farmers can plant vaccinated trees to prevent mealybugs from jumping from one tree to another and spreading the virus.
“Mealybugs have several ways of movement, including moving from canopy to canopy, being carried by ants or blown by the wind,” Chen-Charpentier said. “What we needed to do was create a model for cacao growers so they could know how far away they could safely plant vaccinated trees from unvaccinated trees in order to prevent the spread of the virus while keeping costs manageable for these small farmers.”
By experimenting with mathematical patterning techniques, the team created two different types of models that allow farmers to create a protective layer of vaccinated cacao trees around unvaccinated trees.
“While still experimental, these models are exciting because they would help farmers protect their crops while helping them achieve a better harvest,” Chen-Charpentier said. “This is good for the farmers’ bottom line, as well as our global addiction to chocolate.”",2 days ago,1

President-elect Chapdelaine visit Â· Connecticut College News,"President-elect Andrea E. Chapdelaine, who last month was unanimously appointed to serve as Connecticut College’s 12th president by the Board of Trustees, made her first official visit to campus Wednesday, April 24.
Chapdelaine was welcomed by hundreds of students, faculty and staff at a community meeting in the College Center at Crozier-Williams. After introductory remarks by Board of Trustee Chair Debo P. Adegbile ’91, who co-chaired the 15-member Presidential Search Committee, Chapdelaine took to the podium to address the Conn community.
“This is such an exciting day and I’m thrilled to be here,” Chapdelaine said. “I am very much looking forward to coming to an institution that is fully focused on a rich undergraduate experience, fully dedicated to the liberal arts and putting it into action for our students.”
A strategic leader and compassionate community builder, Chapdelaine has more than 30 years of experience in higher education, having served as a professor, dean, provost and, since 2015, president of Hood College in Frederick, Maryland.
In his introductory remarks, Adegbile said the faculty, staff, students and trustees on the Presidential Search Committee were particularly impressed by Chapdelaine’s academic background in psychology and social justice, her substantial experience as president of a residential college with a diverse student body and her commitment to and belief in the transformative power of the liberal arts.
“There was no person more excited about the possibilities of serving as Connecticut College’s next president, and that exuberance came through throughout the search process,” Adegbile said.
“In President-elect Chapdelaine, we have a leader who is a good listener and mentor, a person who’s deeply committed to educational opportunity for all students and an experienced manager and collaborator who understands what is necessary to make a residential campus community thrive.”
Chapdelaine commended the search process and the “incredibly thoughtful, insightful and committed” committee members. “I felt the strength of the community through their hard work and I feel that they have done an excellent job helping me understand the priorities, the hopes and the dreams for the College as we go forward together,” she said.
During the meeting, Chapdelaine shared with the community how her experiences as a first-generation college student have shaped her career and spoke about how she is excited to be returning to her New England roots. She took questions from the audience, introduced her husband of 29 years, David Tetreault, and told the audience about the other member of the new first family who will be moving onto campus, 15-month-old bernedoodle Koda. “She’s about 70 pounds of love, and, as I like to say, she is exuberant in her response to humanity,” Chapdelaine said, smiling. “She’s a campus dog, and she takes her role very seriously.”
Chapdelaine’s visit also included a tour of the campus, a meeting with her newly appointed transition committee and a lively lunch with students. She will officially begin her tenure at Conn on July 1.
“I cannot thank all of you enough for the warm support and the welcome I have received,” Chapdelaine told the students, faculty and staff.
“You will find in me—and I say this as a promise to all of you today—an accessible leader who is excited to work with you and alongside you.”

"UMaine's new 3D printer smashes former Guinness World Record to advance the 
next generation of advanced ...","Surpassing its own 2019 Guinness World Record for the largest polymer 3D printer, UMaine unveiled a next-generation printer that is four times larger than its predecessor to catalyze the future of sustainable manufacturing in a number of industries. The new printer, dubbed Factory of the Future 1.0 (FoF 1.0), was unveiled on April 23 at the Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC) to an audience that included representatives from the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Energy, the Maine State Housing Authority, industry partners and other stakeholders who plan to utilize this technology. The thermoplastic polymer printer is designed to print objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet high, and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. It offers new opportunities for eco-friendly and cost-effective manufacturing for numerous industries, including national security, affordable housing, bridge construction, ocean and wind energy technologies and maritime vessel fabrication. The design and fabrication of this world-first printer and hybrid manufacturing system was made possible with support from the Office of the Secretary of Defense through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. FoF 1.0 isn’t merely a large-scale printer; it dynamically switches between various processes such as large-scale additive manufacturing, subtractive manufacturing, continuous tape layup and robotic arm operations. Access to it and MasterPrint, the ASCC’s first world-record breaking 3D printer, will streamline manufacturing innovation research at the center. The two large printers can collaborate by sharing the same end-effectors or by working on the same part. “UMaine and the Advanced Structures and Composites Center possess the innovation, capacity, and workforce to support the future needs of the Department of Defense in advanced manufacturing,” said U.S. Sen.

"Empire State Local News Coalition Celebrates Inclusion of $90 Million Local 
Media Tax Credit in Final FY 2025 New ...","Chairman of Committee on Judiciary ( D, WF ) 47th Senate District Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal April 21, 2024 NEW YORK – Today, Governor Kathy Hochul and the New York State Legislature unveiled the final state budget, including a payroll tax credit for local news outlets, modeled on the Local Journalism Sustainability Act, in the sweeping package. With the passage of this bill, New York is now the first state in the nation to incentivize hiring and retaining local journalists. This game changer for the local news industry comes just months after the launch of the Empire State Local News Coalition, an unprecedented, grassroots campaign powered by more than 200 community newspapers across the state. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the Senate bill sponsor, said: “I’m elated that our first-in-the-nation Local Journalism Sustainability Act is passing in the state budget. A thriving local news industry is vital to the health of our democracy and it’s our responsibility to help ensure New Yorkers have access to independent and community-focused journalism. Thank you to Senate Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins, Governor Hochul, our Assembly Sponsor Woerner and the over 200 local publications of the Empire State Local News Coalition who helped pass our bill. Our efforts will help ensure that our democracy will not die in darkness.” The program--$30 million per year for three years--allows each eligible newspaper and broadcast business to receive a 50% refundable tax credit against the first $50,000 of an employee's salary, up to a total of $300,000 per business. $4 million will be allocated to incentivize print and broadcast businesses to hire new journalists. The remaining $26 million will be split evenly between businesses with fewer than 100 employees and those with more than 100 employees, ensuring that hyperlocal, independent news organizations have a fair shot at access to these funds. After stalling for years, the Local Journalism Sustainability Act catapulted into a top legislative priority this session following the early-2024 founding of the Empire State Local News Coalition and the coalition’s mobilization of support from hundreds of New York hometown papers as well as a broad range stakeholders from around the country, including the Rebuild Local News Coalition, Microsoft, and El Diario. Organized labor including NYS AFL-CIO, CWA District 1, and national and local news guilds also played a critical role in mobilizing support for this historic bill. ""The Empire State Local News Coalition is thrilled by the state budget’s inclusion of a payroll tax credit for local news outlets modeled on the Local Journalism Sustainability Act. New York is now the first state in the nation to incentivize hiring and retaining local journalists–a critical investment given that hundreds of New York’s newspapers have closed since 2004, leaving too many New York communities without access to vital local information. The objectivity of this credit shows that there is a fair way for public policy to support local news without jeopardizing journalistic integrity. This program is a model for other states across the U.S. to follow as communities across the country raise their voices to save local news” said Zachary Richner, founder of the Empire State Local News Coalition.“We’re incredibly proud of the 200 newspapers in our coalition, which built an unprecedented grassroots movement in support of saving New York’s local news industry in a few short months. We’re especially grateful to Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, whose tireless advocacy for this tax credit was instrumental in moving it through the legislative process. The coalition thanks Governor Hochul, Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins, Speaker Heastie, Assembly Sponsor Carrie Woerner, and the entire legislature for supporting this industry-saving policy, and we look forward to continuing our advocacy for local news in the years to come,"" Richner continued. “Other states and stakeholders interested in replicating this playbook and hearing about lessons learned should reach out to us at info@savenylocalnews.com.”Since launching in February, the coalition has quickly mobilized stakeholders across the state to rally behind the bill. In addition to rallying with grassroots advocates in Westchester and Albany, members led petition drives, letter-writing campaigns, editorials, and advertisements sounding the alarm on the decline of local journalism. New York’s leadership on this issue could change the course of local journalism in the U.S. The budget’s inclusion of this tax credit comes at a watershed moment for the journalism industry: New York State has experienced hundreds of newspaper closures in the past few decades.

"Israel's military intelligence chief resigns over failure to prevent Hamas 
attack on Oct. 7","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The head of Israel’s military intelligence directorate has resigned over Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, the head of Israel’s military intelligence, becomes the first senior Israeli figure to step down over the failures surrounding Hamas’ attack. It could set the stage for more resignations. Haliva said in October that he shouldered the blame for not preventing the attack, which broke through Israel’s vaunted defenses. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The head of Israeli military intelligence resigned on Monday because of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, becoming the first senior figure to step down over his role in the stunning failure to anticipate or quickly respond to the deadliest assault in Israel’s history. Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva’s decision could set the stage for more resignations among top Israeli security officials. Hamas militants blasted through Israel’s border defenses on Oct. 7, rampaging through communities unchallenged for hours and killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, while taking roughly 250 hostages into Gaza. The attack set off the war against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month. “The intelligence directorate under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me forever,” Haliva wrote in his resignation letter, which was provided by the military. Haliva said he would remain in his position until a replacement is found. He said he had intended to resign immediately after Oct. 7, but stayed on through the initial part of the war and was resigning as the army’s internal investigations gather pace. His announcement came at the start of Passover, a major Jewish holiday, and as military operations in Gaza have slowed in recent weeks ahead of a possible offensive on the southern city of Rafah. The timing of any resignations by security and military officials has been complicated by the ongoing war in Gaza and battles with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah along Israel’s northern border. Tensions with Iran are also at a high following attacks between the two enemies. Some military experts have said resignations at a time when Israel is engaged on multiple fronts is irresponsible and could be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Shortly after the attack, Haliva and others had publicly said that they shouldered blame for not preventing the Oct. 7 assault. Other leaders have stopped short, most notably Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has said he will answer tough questions about his role but has not outright acknowledged direct responsibility for allowing the attack to unfold. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports on a key Israeli military resignation. He has also refused to step down, even as a growing protest movement demands early elections. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed Haliva’s resignation, saying it was “justified and dignified.” “It would be appropriate for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do the same,” he wrote on the social media platform X. The Hamas attack, which came on a Jewish holiday, caught Israel and its vaunted security establishment entirely off guard. Israelis’ sense of faith in their military — seen by most Jews as one of the country’s most trustworthy institutions — was shattered in the face of Hamas’ onslaught. The resignation could help restore some of that trust. The resignation came as Jews around the world prepared to celebrate Passover, a weeklong holiday that begins Monday evening and marks the biblical exodus of Jews from slavery in Egypt. With roughly 130 people still held captive in Gaza, Passover is certain to take on a more somber hue this year: for many Israelis, it’s hard to fathom a celebration of freedom when dozens of people are still being held hostage. “As we gather around the Seder table to commemorate and celebrate our journey from slavery to freedom, our hearts are heavy with the plight of the 133 Israelis who remain in captivity,” Netanyahu wrote on X. “Our resolve remains unyielding to see all hostages back with their families.” Hundreds of Israelis, including families of the hostages, held a protest Seder, or Passover feast, outside Netanyahu’s private home in the coastal city of Caesarea. They blame his government for failing to return the hostages. Hamas’ attack set off the devastating war that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local health ministry. The ministry’s count doesn’t distinguish between combatants and...",3 days ago,1

TikTok ban: ByteDance vows to sue. Will it succeed?,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The Senate passed legislation Tuesday that would force TikTok’s China-based parent company to sell the social media platform under the threat of a ban. Here’s what to know. NEW YORK (AP) — Legislation forcing TikTok’s parent company to sell the video-sharing platform or face a ban in the U.S. received President Joe Biden’s official signoff Wednesday. But the newly minted law could be in for an uphill battle in court. Critics of the sell-or-be-banned ultimatum argue it violates TikTok users’ First Amendment rights. The app’s China-based owner, ByteDance, has already promised to sue, calling the measure unconstitutional. But a court challenge’s success is not guaranteed. The law’s opponents, which include advocacy organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, maintain that the government hasn’t come close to justifying banning TikTok, while others say national-security claims could still prevail. For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data, or influence Americans by suppressing or promoting certain content on TikTok. The U.S. has yet to provide public evidence to support those claims, but political pressures have piled up regardless. If upheld, legal experts also stress that the law could set a precedent carrying wider ramifications for digital media in the U.S. Here’s what you need to know. That’s the central question. TikTok and opponents of the law have argued that a ban would violate First Amendment rights of the social media platform’s 170 million U.S. users. Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU’s National Security Project, said a TikTok ban would “stifle free expression and restrict public access” to a platform that has become central source for information sharing. Among key questions will be whether the legislation interferes with the overall content of speech on TikTok, notes Elettra Bietti, an assistant professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University, because content-based restrictions meet a higher level of scrutiny. ByteDance has yet to officially file a lawsuit, but Bietti said she expects the company’s challenge to primarily focus on whether a ban infringes on these wider free-speech rights. Additional litigation involving TikTok’s “commercial actors,” such as businesses and influencers who make their living on the platform, may also arise, she added. TikTok is expressing confidence about the prospects of its planned challenge. “Rest assured, we aren’t going anywhere,” TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video response posted to X Wednesday. “The facts and the Constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail again.” Toomey also said that he is optimistic about the possibility of TikTok being able to block the measure in court, noting that both users and the company “have extremely strong” First Amendment claims. “Many of the calls to completely ban TikTok in the U.S. are about scoring political points and rooted in anti-China sentiment,” Toomey added. “And to date, these steps to ban TikTok had not been remotely supported by concrete public evidence.” Still, the future of any litigation is hard to predict, especially for this kind of case. And from a legal perspective, it can be difficult to cite political motivations, even if they’re well-documented, as grounds to invalidate a law. The battle could also string along for some time, with the potential for appeals that could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which would likely uphold the law due to its current composition, said Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School. TikTok’s legal challenge won’t go on without a fight. The government will probably respond with national-security claims, which were already cited prominently as the legislation made its way through Congress. Toomey maintains that the government hasn’t met the high bar required to prove imminent national-security risks, but some other legal experts note that it’s still a strong card to play. “One of the unfortunate and really frustrating things about national-security legislation (is that) it tends to be a trump card,” Hurwitz said. “Once national-security issues come up, they’re going to carry the day either successfully or not.” Hurwitz added that he thinks there are legitimate national-security arguments that could be brought up here. National security can be argued because it’s a federal measure, he noted. That sets this scenario apart from previously unsuccessful state-level legislation seeking to ban TikTok, such as in Montana. But national-security arguments are also vulnerable to questioning as to why TikTok is getting specific scrutiny. “Personally, I believe that...",24 hours ago,1

News Release
WASHINGTON – The Biden-Harris administration today announced a final rule that expands overtime protections for millions of the nation’s lower-paid salaried workers by increasing the salary thresholds required to exempt a salaried bona fide executive, administrative or professional employee from federal overtime pay requirements. 
Effective July 1, 2024, the salary threshold will increase to the equivalent of an annual salary of $43,888 and increase to $58,656 on Jan. 1, 2025. The July 1 increase updates the present annual salary threshold of $35,568 based on the methodology used by the prior administration in the 2019 overtime rule update. On Jan. 1, 2025, the rule’s new methodology takes effect, resulting in the additional increase. In addition, the rule will adjust the threshold for highly compensated employees. Starting July 1, 2027, salary thresholds will update every three years, by applying up-to-date wage data to determine new salary levels.
“This rule will restore the promise to workers that if you work more than 40 hours in a week, you should be paid more for that time,” said Acting Secretary Julie Su. “Too often, lower-paid salaried workers are doing the same job as their hourly counterparts but are spending more time away from their families for no additional pay. That is unacceptable. The Biden-Harris administration is following through on our promise to raise the bar for workers who help lay the foundation for our economic prosperity.”
The department conducted extensive engagement with employers, workers, unions and other stakeholders before issuing its proposed rule in September 2023, and considered more than 33,000 comments in developing its final rule. The updated rule defines and delimits who is a bona fide executive, administrative and professional employee exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act’s overtime protections. 
“The Department of Labor is ensuring that lower-paid salaried workers receive their hard-earned pay or get much-deserved time back with their families,” said Wage and Hour Administrator Jessica Looman. “This rule establishes clear, predictable guidance for employers on how to pay employees for overtime hours and provides more economic security to the millions of people working long hours without overtime pay.”
Key provisions of the final rule include the following:
The rule’s effective date is July 1, 2024. Learn more about the department’s efforts to restore and extend overtime protections.

Poll: Election interest hits new low in tight Biden-Trump race,"Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. The poll also shows Biden trimming Trump’s previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as Biden bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while Trump is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation. And it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy. But what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could scramble what has been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden head to head, Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates. “I don’t think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it’s going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,” said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he’s still voting for Biden. “I just don’t feel like I have a candidate that I’m excited to vote for,” Fletcher added. Another poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn’t be voting in November. “Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,” she said. Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said, “Americans don’t agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters’ desire to tune this election out.” The poll was conducted April 12-16, during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump’s criminal trial in New York and new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East. According to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have high levels of interest in November’s election — registering either a “9” or a 10” on a 10-point scale of interest. That’s lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests. The question dates to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey. This election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll. McInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has “always been a signal for the level of turnout” for a presidential contest. “It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,” he said. By party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the coming election, compared with 65% of Democrats who say so. Independents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election. “They just aren’t low interest,” McInturff said of young voters. “They are off-the-charts low.” Professional pollsters at a Democratic polling firm (Hart Research Associates) and a Republican firm (Public Opinion Strategies) have worked together to conduct and operate this poll since 1989. (Coldwater Corporation served as the Republican firm from 1989-2004.) The polling firms employ a call center, where live interviewers speak by cell phone and telephone with a cross section of (usually) 1,000 respondents. The respondents are randomly selected from national lists of households and cell numbers. Respondents are asked for by name, starting with the youngest male adult or female adult in the household.

Klagsbrun Symposium Â· Connecticut College News,"When Professor of English and Poet-in-Residence Kate Rushin asked award-winning Haitian American author Edwidge Danticat why she writes, Danticat replied, “It never felt like I had a choice.” Danticat was the featured author at the 20th Daniel Klagsbrun Symposium on Creative Arts and Moral Vision at Connecticut College. On the afternoon of April 18—just prior to the emergence of a vivid double rainbow that would frame the campus—Rushin engaged Danticat in a wide-ranging conversation before a standing-room-only audience in the College’s Blaustein Humanities Center. After the talk, the visiting author took questions and treated the gathered students, faculty, staff and local community members to a reading and book-signing. Earlier in the day, Danticat met with Rushin’s creative writing students and Visiting Assistant Professor and Writer-in-Residence Courtney Sender and her students. Danticat was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Her family eventually left the Caribbean country’s Duvalier dictatorship and settled in New York City. Her parents wanted her to be a doctor, Danticat recalled, so they enrolled her in the Clara Barton High School for Health Sciences in Brooklyn. When she decided to pursue her MFA in creative writing instead, she told them she was going to be a teacher. “For my parents, being a writer meant that you were setting yourself up to be killed,” Danticat said. “All the writers they’d ever heard about had been murdered or exiled.” She lightened the mood by mentioning the time Oprah lauded her first novel, sending it to the top of the bestseller list in 1998. She joked, “When Breath, Eyes, Memory was on Oprah’s Book Club, I remember my dad was like, ‘Oh, finally, you’ll have enough money for medical school.’” Rushin, who met Danticat while they were both earning MFAs at Brown University, asked Danticat to elaborate on her writing, which often centers on dark parts of Haitian history and her own family history. “When you write about these difficult topics, you’re also talking about love and family and community. How do you navigate these different subjects, and the personal losses that you’ve gone through, to be able to produce your work?” Rushin asked. Danticat said, “I see my work as a way of processing my loss. In my memoir, Brother, I’m Dying, in the same year, my Uncle Rick, who raised me, died in immigration custody, my father had pulmonary fibrosis and my daughter was born—there was this circularity of life. I realized the book was coming together so fast because writing the book was like visiting with my uncle and father who had passed. I was with them in those pages. The writing itself is part of the grieving process.” Danticat has won numerous awards, including the MacArthur Foundation Fellowship and several National Book Critics Circle Awards. She was recently appointed the Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Professor of the Humanities in the Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies at Columbia University. Her 20 published works include Breath, Eyes, Memory; National Book Award finalist Krik? Krak!; American Book Award winner The Farming of Bones; and The Art of Death, a National Book Critics Circle finalist for Criticism. Brother, I’m Dying was a 2007 finalist for the National Book Award and a 2008 winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for autobiography. Her book of essays, We’re Alone, is coming out later this year, and her novel, The Once and Future Dead, will be published in 2025. Rushin and Associate Professor of English Jeff Strabone organized the recent event, which was a collaboration between the Department of English and the Office of Advancement. Rushin credited the impressive turnout and lively Q&A session to the work her fellow English professors did to prepare their students for Danticat’s visit. Strabone said, “It was a joyous occasion to see two great American authors, Edwidge Danticat and our own Kate Rushin, talk about writing and literature at a high, yet accessible level. And, at the same time, we honored the legacy of the Klagsbrun family, who have been great friends of the English Department and the College for decades.” The Daniel Klagsbrun Symposium was established in 1989 to create a positive, living memorial to Daniel Klagsbrun, a 1986 graduate of Connecticut College. Through the generosity and commitment of Daniel’s parents, Emilie and Herbert Klagsbrun, the symposium has brought to the College an amazing array of authors, including: Dorothy Allison, Saul Bellow, Joseph Brodsky, Sandra Cisneros, Michael Cunningham, E.L. Doctorow, Jhumpa Lahiri, Wally Lamb, Colum McCann, Jay McInerney, Adrienne Rich, David Sedaris, Jessica Soffer ’07,...",21 hours ago,1

 Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

 Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People ‘In The Eye’,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former sheriff tweeted.  I will continue to poke them in the eye with a sharp stick and bitch slap these scum bags til they get it.

 Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name Coded Into His Website (IMAGES),"On Christmas day, Donald Trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day, but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row.

The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.

 Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech,"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.","December 25, 2017",0
 Racist Alabama Cops Brutalize Black Boy While He Is In Handcuffs (GRAPHIC IMAGES),"The number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. No way in hell would this have happened if Angela Williams  son had been white.

" Fresh Off The Golf Course, Trump Lashes Out At FBI Deputy Director And James Comey","Donald Trump spent a good portion of his day at his golf club, marking the 84th day he s done so since taking the oath of office. It must have been a bad game because just after that, Trump lashed out at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter following a report saying McCabe plans to retire in a few months. The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

Trump has been fact-checked before on his claim of his wife receiving $700,000 for her campaign.Politifact noted in late July that Trump s  tweet about Andrew McCabe is a significant distortion of the facts. And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn t make much sense when we look at the evidence. His July tweet was rated  mostly false.  But Trump repeats these lies because he knows his supporters will believe them without bothering to Google. It s still a lie, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.","December 23, 2017",0
" Trump Said Some INSANELY Racist Stuff Inside The Oval Office, And Witnesses Back It Up","In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images","December 23, 2017",0
" Former CIA Director Slams Trump Over UN Bullying, Openly Suggests He’s Acting Like A Dictator (TWEET)","Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Donald Trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Republican David Frum just a couple of months into Donald Trump s presidency, in a piece in The Atlantic called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Trump s former political opponent, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, already has a rogue band of Republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Trump making United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley bully and threaten other countries in the United Nations who voted against Trump s decision to change U.S. policy when it comes to recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State. Well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of Trump s autocratic antics: Former CIA Director John O. Brennan. The seasoned spy took to Trump s favorite platform, Twitter, and blasted the decision:Trump Admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in UN to oppose US position on Jerusalem is beyond outrageous. Shows @realDonaldTrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) December 21, 2017Director Brennan is correct, of course. Trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the American president. Fellow Americans, we know the GOP-led Congress will not be the check on Trump that they are supposed to be. It s time to get out and flip the House and possibly the Senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like Russia or North Korea than the America we have always know. We re already well on our way.Featured image via BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images","December 22, 2017",0
 WATCH: Brand-New Pro-Trump Ad Features So Much A** Kissing It Will Make You Sick,"Just when you might have thought we d get a break from watching people kiss Donald Trump s ass and stroke his ego ad nauseam, a pro-Trump group creates an ad that s nothing but people doing even more of those exact things. America First Policies is set to release this ad, called  Thank You, President Trump,  on Christmas Day and, well, we threw up a little in our mouths trying to watch this.Basically, the spot is nothing but people fawning all over Trump for all the stuff he hasn t actually done. The ad includes a scene with a little girl thanking Trump for bringing back  Merry Christmas,  which never went away (there are even videos of President Obama saying  Merry Christmas  himself). A man thanks him for cutting his taxes. And America First says that everyday Americans everywhere are thanking Trump for being such a great and awesome president.The best president.Nobody s ever done what he s done. He s breaking all kinds of records every day.Believe us.Anyway, the word  propaganda  comes to mind when watching this. That s what it is   literal propaganda promoting someone who shouldn t need this kind of promotion anymore. Watch this ad bullshit below:The way the MAGAs are kowtowing to Orange Hitler is both disgusting and frightening. The man has done nothing, and his policies will harm the very same Americans who are thanking him. Unfortunately, it will take an obscene amount of pain before they ll open their eyes and see they ve been duped by a con man with a bad hairdo.And his ongoing need for this kind of adoration is, at best, unbecoming of his office.

" Papa John’s Founder Retires, Figures Out Racism Is Bad For Business","A centerpiece of Donald Trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways. That is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color. One of his favorite targets, is, of course, the players in the National Football League who dare to exercise their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality. Well, there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business, even if it did get the orange overlord elected: The founder of the pizza chain Papa John s.This is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues, and plus his pizza sucks. But, when he decided to complain about the players protesting, his sales really dropped. Turns out racism doesn t pay, and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line. Therefore, Papa John Schnatter will no longer be CEO of the hack pizza chain.BREAKING: Papa John's founder John Schnatter to step down as CEO; announcement comes weeks after he criticized NFL over protests.  AP Business News (@APBusiness) December 21, 2017The thing is, while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions, they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people, which one would presume is the goal of all CEO s. No one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders, the public outcry or boycotts, or even the NFL itself had anything to do with his stepping down. As of right now, all we know is that he will be gone, and perhaps the future CEO will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call America. After all, the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the Statue of Liberty, and bigots like Trump and Schnatter are the past. The rest of us are the future. We just have to survive the present to get there.Featured image via Rob Kim/Getty Images","December 21, 2017",0

Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points. With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know, Ryan claimed that the $2,059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote. Watch Ryan completely dismiss all the struggling families living in blue states below:If you re living paycheck-to-paycheck which is more than half of the people in this country and you got #2059more from a tax cut next year, that s not nothing. pic.twitter.com/8TKtrMqRa1  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) December 21, 2017Someone needs to reach through their computer or television and wipe that smugness off his face.

 Bad News For Trump — Mitch McConnell Says No To Repealing Obamacare In 2018,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","December 21, 2017",0
" WATCH: Lindsey Graham Trashes Media For Portraying Trump As ‘Kooky,’ Forgets His Own Words","The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed. But the media isn t quite saying what Trump wants. They ve been doing analysis and discussion all day long rather than praising it for the grand achievement Trump believes it is.

 Heiress To Disney Empire Knows GOP Scammed Us – SHREDS Them For Tax Bill,"Abigail Disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the GOP tax scam bill but isn t into f-cking poor people over. Ms. Disney penned an op-ed for USA Today in which she rips the GOP a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality.  In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

 Tone Deaf Trump: Congrats Rep. Scalise On Losing Weight After You Almost Died,"Donald Trump just signed the GOP tax scam into law. Of course, that meant that he invited all of his craven, cruel GOP sycophants down from their perches on Capitol Hill to celebrate in the Rose Garden at the White House. Now, that part is bad enough   celebrating tax cuts for a bunch of rich hedge fund managers and huge corporations at the expense of everyday Americans. Of course, Trump is beside himself with glee, as this represents his first major legislative win since he started squatting in the White House almost a year ago. Thanks to said glee, in true Trumpian style, he gave a free-wheeling address, and a most curious subject came up as Trump was thanking the goons from the Hill. Somehow, Trump veered away from tax cuts, and started talking about the Congressional baseball shooting that happened over the summer.In that shooting, Rep. Steve Scalise, who is also the House Majority Whip, was shot and almost lost his life. Thanks to this tragic and stunning act of political violence, Scalise had a long recovery; in fact he is still in physical therapy. But, of course, vain and looks-obsessed Trump decided that he would congratulate Scalise, not on his survival and on his miraculous recovery, but on the massive amount of weight Scalise lost while he was practically dying. And make no mistake   Scalise is VERY lucky to be alive. According to doctors, when he arrived at the hospital, Scalise was actually, quote, in  imminent risk of death.  Here is the quote, via Twitter:How stunningly tone deaf does one have to be to say something like that? I never thought I d say this about a Republican that I, by all reasonable accounts, absolutely loathe, but I feel sorry for him. I am sorry he got shot, and I am even sorrier that he now has to stand there and listen to that orange buffoon talk about him like that.I am sure that Scalise is a much tougher man than Trump, though.

 Mueller Spokesman Just F-cked Up Donald Trump’s Christmas,"Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.","December 17, 2017",0
 SNL Hilariously Mocks Accused Child Molester Roy Moore For Losing AL Senate Race (VIDEO),"Right now, the whole world is looking at the shocking fact that Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore in the special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the United States Senate. Of course, Moore s candidacy was rocked by allegations of sexually harassing and even molesting teenage girls   and being banned from the mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama for doing so.Even before that, Moore was an incendiary character in Alabama politics, having been removed as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court not once but twice, and having made statements such as Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and homosexuality should be illegal. Hell, he even said that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. Therefore, he was an extraordinarily damaged candidate as it was. However, despite all of this, Alabama is a deep red state, with many voters agreeing with some of Moore s more extreme positions, and some even insisting that the allegations of sexual misconduct were simply not true. That is why it was such a shock that Doug Jones pulled out a win for that Senate seat.Well, there is one entity that could not resist going all in on the fact that Roy Moore lost this race: Saturday Night Live. While doing a caricature of the results, SNL began, with its Weekend Update host Colin Jost brutally mocking Moore s alleged proclivities fore teen girls: Congratulations to Alabama s newest Senator   not Roy Moore. Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in over 20 years. Said Roy Moore:  gross, over 20 years? Jost then got in a dig at Trump, for whom Moore s loss was  a humiliating failure, remind everyone what Trump said of Jones  win: The Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! Indeed. If the sane people of America have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time after 2018 before the GOP is allowed to control anything. Jost continued mocking Trump: That s it? You just went all in for an accused pedophile and when he lost, [you re] just like,  well, we had fun! He could be removed from office tonight and tweet:  Congratulations to Robert Mueller on a great investigation. Had a fun time being president. Catch you on the flippity-flop! #DietCokeTime . Oh, if only that could be our reality, to have Trump congratulating Mueller for removing him and his entire treasonous, criminal administration. Until then, we ll have to stick to  Weekend Update  and the rest of SNL, and hope for the best.Watch the video below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images","December 17, 2017",0

" In A Heartless Rebuke To Victims, Trump Invites NRA To Xmas Party On Sandy Hook Anniversary","It almost seems like Donald Trump is trolling America at this point. In the beginning, when he tried to gaslight the country by insisting that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest ever   or that it was even close to the last couple of inaugurations   we all kind of scratched our heads and wondered what kind of bullshit he was playing at. Then when he started appointing people to positions they had no business being in, we started to worry that this was going to go much worse than we had expected.After 11 months of Donald Trump pulling the rhetorical equivalent of whipping his dick out and slapping it on every table he gets near, I think it s time we address what s happening: Dude is a straight-up troll. He gets pleasure out of making other people uncomfortable or even seeing them in distress. He actively thinks up ways to piss off people he doesn t like.Let s set aside just for a moment the fact that that s the least presidential  behavior anyone s ever heard of   it s dangerous.His latest stunt is one of the grossest yet.Everyone is, by now, used to Trump not talking about things he doesn t want to talk about, and making a huge deal out of things that not many people care about. So it wasn t a huge surprise when the president didn t discuss the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012 on the fifth anniversary of that tragic event. What was a huge surprise was that he not only consciously decided not to invite the victims  families to the White House Christmas party this year   as they have been invited every year since the massacre took place, along with others who share those concerns.In each of the past 4 years, President Obama invited gun violence prevention activists, gun violence survivors (including the Sandy Hook families) and supportive lawmakers to his Christmas party. Zero gun lobbyists were in attendance. pic.twitter.com/QePW9FtbSh  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017The last sentence of that tweet is important, because that s exactly who Donald Trump did invite to the White House Christmas party. Instead of victims. On the anniversary day.Yesterday was the 5 year mark of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook School, which went unacknowledged by the President. On the same day, he hosted a White House Christmas party to which he invited @NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. Here he is at the party with @DanPatrick. pic.twitter.com/mUbKCIWGxB  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017Wayne LaPierre is the man who, in response to the Sandy Hook massacre, finally issued a statement that blamed gun violence on music, movies, and video games, and culminated with perhaps the greatest bit of irony any man has ever unintentionally conceived of: Isn t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? Yes. Yes, it is, Wayne.Anyway, Happy Holidays Merry Christmas from Donald Trump, everyone!Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images","December 16, 2017",0
 KY GOP State Rep. Commits Suicide Over Allegations He Molested A Teen Girl (DETAILS),"In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture","December 13, 2017",0
 Meghan McCain Tweets The Most AMAZING Response To Doug Jones’ Win In Deep-Red Alabama,"As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does. Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General. And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain   John McCain s daughter. She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words. It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration. Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year. Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia. Bannon even said,  There s a special place in hell  for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls. They rejected his hate and bigotry. They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law. And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated. If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can. And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office. Even Republicans have their limits, it seems.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images","December 12, 2017",0
 CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years,"Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere. Get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the GOP outta the water in 2018.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","December 12, 2017",0
 White House: It Wasn’t Sexist For Trump To Slut-Shame Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (VIDEO),"A backlash ensued after Donald Trump launched a sexist rant against Kirsten Gillibrand Thursday morning, saying that the Democratic Senator  would do anything  for a campaign contribution. Trump was calling Gillibrand a whore.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders somehow denied that Trump s tweet was sexist. There is no way that is sexist at all,  Sanders told reporters.Then Sanders tried to explain what Trump really meant (we all know what he really meant). According to Sanders, Trump was merely accusing Gillibrand of being  controlled by contributions,  and hammering home his pledge to  drain the swamp  in Washington, according to The Hill. I think that the president is very obvious,  she said.  This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed the corruption of the entire political system. Sanders claims that Trump does not owe Gillibrand an apology if his words were taken as sexist. I think only if your mind is in the gutter you would have read it that way, so no,  she said.Watch:Gillibrand called on Trump to resign after Trump s accusers came back into the spotlight by hosting a press conference in which they called for an investigation into his past behavior. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office  begging  for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!  Trump tweeted this morning.Gillibrand responded to Trump s attack, saying that she won t be silenced.

 Despicable Trump Suggests Female Senator Would ‘Do Anything’ With Him For Campaign Money (TWEET),"Donald Trump is afraid of strong, powerful women. He is a horrific misogynist, and has shown himself to be so over and over again. That is nothing new. He has mocked the weight of a beauty queen, made repeated suggestions about women s menstrual cycles, and had repeatedly called women who accuse men   including himself   of sexual harassment and sexual assault of being liars and threatened to sue him. Now, he has gone even lower with an attack on Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY).In an early morning tweet, Trump actually suggested that Senator Gillibrand would have sex with him for campaign money. No, I m not kidding. Here is the tweet:Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office  begging  for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2017For one thing, I don t think Kirsten Gillibrand has to beg the likes of Donald Trump for anything, and she certainly would not stoop anywhere near doing what Trump is suggesting for campaign money. Think about this, folks: the sitting  president  is actually saying that a sitting Senator offered him sex in exchange for campaign money. That is truly beyond the pale. We already knew that Donald Trump was a sexist asshole, but this is a new low, even for him.General Kelly, General McMaster, and whomever else is running that White House   DO SOMETHING about this fool s Twitter habit. It is way out of control, and he does great damage to the nation with ever 140 280 character outburst. This is outrageous. Forget the fact that the orange overlord is currently squatting in the Oval Office   no adult, period, should be acting like this.In this watershed  Me Too  moment in America, it is time to call out the Sexist-in-Chief for what he is   a complete misogynist who has no respect for women and never has. Ivanka, Melania, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Hope Hicks, and all the other women in Trump s orbit need to step up and say that there s been more than enough. Curtail this man s sexist behavior, or turn in your woman card. Every last one of you.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images","December 12, 2017",0
 Accused Child Molesting Senate Candidate Roy Moore Sides With Putin Over Reagan (VIDEO),"Ronald Reagan is largely seen as the Messiah of the Republican Party. Despite how long it has been since the man was president, he has always remained the high standard of GOP morality for potential office holders. That is, until now. Reagan is likely rolling over in his grave at the idea of the state of his party with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer, and he s likely doing the same at the prospect of a bigoted accused child molester like Roy Moore (R-AL) being the next GOP Senator from Alabama. Well, now Reagan has another reason to hate Moore: He s clearly in the pocket of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin just like Donald Trump is.During an interview where he s talking about Americans being the face of  evil  in the world right now, Moore indicates that Putin s harsh and murderous treatment of LGBTQ people in Russia is something he would like to see happen in the United States. Then, he does something most appalling, and goes on to give Putin a message in Russian. Now, no one knows where a bigoted, backwoods buffoon like Roy Moore would learn Russian. After all, he s barely left Alabama, where he has spent the last 40+ years wreacking havoc and just basically cementing Alabama s place as America s bigoted boil on the butt of humanity wherever and whenever he can. However, he managed to learn enough Russian to dog whistle to Putin in that interview. That should disturb us all. Not only is the man being a homophobe, a racist, a misogynist, and more than likely a child molester, he s also a Russian stooge.America, we can do better. We have enough Russian puppets at the highest levels of government. Lord knows we don t need one in the United States Senate.Watch the appalling video below:Please watch this until the end, Roy Moore sides with Putin over Reagan, says that America is the focus of evil in the world, and sends a nice message to Putin in Russian. pic.twitter.com/wFgDkvzEhT  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) December 10, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images","December 11, 2017",0

On Saturday night, Pirro said there needs to be a  cleansing  at the FBI and the Department of Justice.Pirro claims that quite a few officials are protecting Hillary Clinton   who does not hold public office   or are destroying Donald Trump, and singled out Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, FBI official Peter Strzok, former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, former FBI Director James Comey and you guessed it: Special Counsel Robert Mueller   all of whom she says need to be arrested and placed in handcuffs. There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made,  she shrieked.  This is one of those times. There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice   it needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired. But who need to be taken out in cuffs,  Pirro declared.Watch:.@JudgeJeanine:  There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made.

For that, he was sentenced to spend over two years  locked up  in prison for improperly deducting $1.2 million of his personal expenses as business write-offs while living a lavish lifestyle. Mr. Pirro was convicted on all 34 counts.Pirro split with her hubby after he admitted to fathering a child with another woman. He told the press and Pirro failed to give him enough attention. I know! Maybe if he changed his name to Hillary Clinton then he d get all the attention he needs.Pirro s hatred for Hillary Clinton goes way back and it appears to stem from jealousy.Maybe Pirro should heed the advice from Pirro in 2016 when she said,  We cannot have a country run by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictments and never-ending hearings [W]hether she s indicted or even guilty, it doesn t matter.

" BREAKING: Cop Finally Gets His Due, Walter Scott’s Killer Sentenced To Prison (DETAILS)","In America, we have been having a conversation about police brutality against black Americans. Despite the countless black people murdered unjustly by police, there is usually no justice. Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Keith Lamont Scott, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray too many to mention here, really. All of those people were senselessly murdered by cops who chose to be their judges, juries, and executioners, and they did so with impunity and without consequence. However, there is hope, and it is coming out of South Carolina, of all places.North Charleston police officer Michael Slager murdered Walter Scott, a black man who was fleeing after a routine traffic stop in cold blood in 2015. He would have gotten away with it, too, had it not been for a citizen who was brave enough to tape the murder. The tape showed that Slager had lied about his life being in danger, and it showed him cuffing Scott s lifeless body, and then planting a taser as  evidence.  Here is the news report of that damning tape:Thanks to that tape, Slager was arrested and charged with murder. Now, fast forward two years later, and Slager has been convicted of murder. U.S. District Judge David Norton decided to throw the book at Slager, and sentenced the murdering ex-cop to 19-24 years in prison.The original case ended in a mistrial, but the state of South Carolina seemed determined to get justice for Walter Scott, and that happened on December 7, 2017.  Of course, Slager s family begged for mercy from the judge, but luckily those calls were ignored. Michael Slager is a murderer, and he deserves the sentence he got.So many times, these cases end with the murderous cops back on the force, out in the streets after what amounts to nothing more than a paid vacation, free to murder another black person at will again. Thankfully, for once, the system worked as it should. For once, I am proud to be a South Carolinian. Hopefully this sets a precedent, and helps us turn a corner toward the arc of justice.Watch the video of the remarks of the Scott family below: Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images","December 7, 2017",0
 Watch: Is This Proof Trump Is Unfit for Service?,"New questions are being asked about President Donald Trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his Jerusalem decision. Possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the White House explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. Morning Joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, Trump has opted not to get his physicals at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Questions about Trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. While he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. He was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-Muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the United Kingdom.One psychiatrist talk to MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnel about his impressions of Trump s state of mind.Many think that any degradation in Trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from Robert Mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. This has increased since former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.All of this talk is leading to more people to ask if Trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Jamie D. Raskin (D-MD) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. As published in the Washington Post, it says: Please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 1987, the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. It sets up and defines the Congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet or the Vice-President and a majority of  such other body as Congress may by law provide  can determine that the President is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years Congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. Perhaps it never occurred to prior Congresses that setting up this body was necessary. For obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. While the Republicans in the Cabinet and Congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images","December 7, 2017",0
" Trump Completely SCREWS The Middle East Peace Process, Just Another Wednesday For Him","On Wednesday, Donald Trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism. According to Christian traditions, the Jews will all die in the Apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.No wonder they re mostly Republicans.Watch Trump s announcement here:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","December 6, 2017",0
 Trump Only Cares About Trump; Why He Is Recognizing Jerusalem Today,"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.","December 6, 2017",0
 Watch: Trump Supporting Coal CEO Upset Trump Is Wiping Out ‘Thousands’ Of Coal Mining Jobs,"While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to revive the coal industry and after he took power, he signed an executive order rolling back a temporary ban on mining coal and a stream protection rule that was imposed by the Obama administration. Trump vowed to bring back thousands of mining jobs in struggling rural areas.  I made them this promise,  Trump said,  we will put our miners back to work. That was then and this is now.Coal CEO Robert Murray, a fierce supporter of Trump s, warns that if the Senate version of tax reform is enacted by the current occupant of the White House, he will be destroying thousands of coal mining jobs in the process.Murray said the Senate legislation will raise Murray Energy s taxes by $60 million a year,  notwithstanding the other so-called benefits the Senate has proposed,  CNBC reports. This means that very capital-intensive, highly leveraged employers, like coal-mining companies, will be forced out of business, with tragic consequences for our families and for many regions of our country,  Murray said. We won t have enough cash flow to exist. It wipes us out,  Murray told CNNMoney in an interview on Tuesday. This wipes out everything that President Trump has done for coal,  said Murray, the head of one of America s largest coal companies.CNN reports:Murray warned that a bankruptcy of his Ohio-based company would hurt its 5,500 employees along with their families. Asked if other coal mining companies could go out of business, he said:  Most certainly. Watch:Murray hosted a fundraiser for Trump during the campaign. And today, Murray warns that the GOP tax plan will  wipe out  coal mining jobs.Who saw this coming? Besides all of us. Trump supporters have been suckered.Image via screen capture.

" Sitting GOP Senator Has Had ENOUGH, Donates To Alabama Democrat For Senate (IMAGE)","Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake has never been a fan of Donald Trump or his incendiary, divisive brand of politics. Now, he is a leading GOP voice against electing Roy Moore (R-AL) to the United States Senate. Moore is an accused child molester, and has a lifetime history of making all kinds of bigoted and incendiary comments. He has said that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Moore was also removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for refusing to comply with higher court rulings. Well, Flake has finally had enough of his party enabling characters like Moore. He had already said that if he lived in Alabama, he d be voting for Democrat Doug Jones. Now, Flake  has taken his support of Jones even further, in the wake of the Republican National Committee s decision to support an accused child molester rather than a Democrat.Taking to Twitter, Senator Flake posted an image of a check   made out to Doug Jones  Senate campaign. Here is the tweet, captioned  Country over Party :Country over Party pic.twitter.com/JZMTaEYdxQ  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2017Now, I don t agree with Jeff Flake on anything politically, but I can say that he is trying to act with morality and decency here. One could argue that Flake s plans to retire from the Senate mean that he can do this without consequence, but at this point, that matters not. We do not need a pedophile in the United States Senate, and the GOP apparatus should be ashamed of themselves for trying to get Roy Moore elected. But, hey   better a pedophile than a Democrat, right?Featured image Drew Angerer/Getty Images","December 5, 2017",0
 Republican National Committee: Better A Pedophile Than A Democrat In The U.S. Senate,"By now, the whole world knows that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R-Of Course) was banned from an Alabama mall and the YMCA for creeping on little girls. He has been accused of molesting young girls as young as age fourteen. Of course, when the allegations first came out and the uproar and backlash began, everyone, regardless of politics, reacted with outrage. However, the GOP s outrage was often much more muted. Further, it took awhile for the Republican National Committee to pull their support for Moore, despite the deeply disturbing allegations of his being a pedophile. Well, now that the rage has died down, the RNC is back with a new message regarding this Senate race: Better a pedophile than a Democrat.Under cover of night, the RNC reinstated their support for Roy Moore, and an RNC official confirmed to The Hill that, quote, We can confirm our involvement in the Alabama Senate race. So, there you have it, folks. They literally want a child molester in the United States Senate rather than a Democrat. There are only a few voices from the right who are being brave on this one   and none of them are seeking re-election. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tweeted that the GOP must not tolerate Moore:Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017Outgoing Arizona GOP Senator Jeff Flake has actually said that he would vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, if he lived in Alabama, and former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller has actually endorsed and donated to Jones. Outgoing Pennsylvania moderate Republican Charlie Dent said he never supported Moore in the first place. Here s the video of Dent s takedown of Moore:There is also outspoken Trump critic and longtime GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who went on national television and called Moore a pedophile:Other than that, though, it has been radio silence. After all, they need that vote. Besides, let s face it   the GOP writ large showed America and the world what they stand for when they elected Donald Trump.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images","December 5, 2017",0
 Donald Trump’s Eating Habits Could Be Dramatically Affecting His Wellbeing And Our Safety,"We ve all heard the stories of Donald Trump preferring a well-done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies, despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire, however, it s not just that the President has terrible gastronomical taste, a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life.According to an excerpt from Let Trump be Trump, an upcoming book by Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and aide David Bossie, we get to enter the inner circle where the President of the United States having a 2,400-calorie McDonald s dinner is par for the course. Trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to McDonald s, with a dinner order consisting of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,  is just one of the claims made in the book. To put that meal in perspective, Trump s dinner contains 3,400 grams of sodium, despite the American Heart Foundation recommending just 1,500 grams per day, plus enough white bread to last most people a week. Remember, this is just one meal, but it only gets worse. On Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza, and Diet Coke,  the authors write about traveling with Trump during the early days of his presidency, but there may be a valid reason for it   Not only is he a fan of manufacturing, Trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened, which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with Vienna Fingers, potato chips, pretzels, and many packages of Oreos.  Those well-done steaks make a little more sense now, as well. But a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the President s worries. This is a 71-year-old man who gets next to no exercise (it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing), gets very little sleep, and is constantly throwing tantrums, so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack. The diet alone, especially the snacks, is almost an open-invite for diabetes, too.What makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with North Korea, as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever-increasing tax bill. If he has this lack of concern for his own wellbeing, then what does it say of his risk-assessment abilities?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images","December 5, 2017",0
" John McCain Wanted Another 74 Twitter Followers, But His Plan Backfired Miserably (TWEETS)","All Senator John McCain wanted to achieve on the morning of Monday, December 4 was to hit that magic milestone of three million Twitter followers, a goal of which he was just 74 followers shy. So what was McCain s approach to gaining those new followers? Simple, he would go on Twitter and rely on word-of-mouth, how could that possibly fail?We're only 74 Twitter followers away from 3M   spread the word & help us reach this big milestone!  John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) December 4, 2017There was just one little thing Senator McCain had forgotten to factor in   His significantly waning popularity since he voted for the Republican tax bill. Being the Republican Senator for Arizona, some may have seen this as him just batting for his own team, but let s not forget that John McCain was one of the few glimmers of hope as he was also one of the only Republicans that has been openly critical of President Trump and this is a terrible tax bill.Not only will the new tax measures raise taxes on those earning less than $75,000 per annum, it would also take healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise the national debt by almost $1.5 trillion dollars over the coming decade! To add insult to injury, the 479-page bill wasn t even completed when it was released on Friday night, with some pages crossed out and others with hand-written amendments in the margins. Furthermore, nobody even had a chance to read it when they were forced to vote on it, but that didn t sway McCain and the bill somehow managed to pass the Senate.UPDATE: Senate Republicans are so desperate to pass their tax bill tonight that they're now making handwritten changes to their already handwritten changes Seriously. pic.twitter.com/KQfW7bOyk1  Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) December 2, 2017Some people had grown to believe that Senator McCain wasn t too bad for a Republican, but when he shocked everyone and voted in favor of the new tax bill, one where 13 million taxpayers will lose their healthcare but still subsidize his treatment for brain cancer, he proved he was no different and people decided to revolt. So when McCain put out the plea for another 74 followers to reach the three million mark, Twitter-users instead instigated a massive unfollow campaign using the hashtag #UnfollowMcCain, costing him hundreds of followers every minute.Over 5,000 people have unfollowed you since you sent this this two hours ago.One reason is you because you   a man undergoing cancer treatment   voted to strip $25 BILLION dollars from the part of Medicare which pays for CANCER TREATMENT.#unfollowmccain https://t.co/gWl6KsAaLE  Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) December 4, 2017I m happy to report that @SenJohnMcCain has lost more than 10,000 followers since I posted the below tweet.

 ‘Ghost Of Witness Flipped’: Hilarious SNL Skit Takes Trump Into His Own Private Holiday Hell (VIDEO),"By now, everyone knows that disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has flipped on Donald Trump. Of course, the good folks at Saturday Night Live, who have been mocking Trump relentlessly, couldn t resist using this to needle the notoriously thin -skinned, sorry excuse for a  president.  It also helps that we are in the midst of the holiday season, which enabled SNL to use a seasonal classic, A Christmas Carol, to poke fun at Trump.Alec Baldwin took up the mantle to play Trump again, who is visited by a fictional Michael Flynn (Mikey Day) in chains, and seems positively terrified of the Ghost of Michael Flynn, who appears to tell Trump, it s time to come clean for the good of the country.

Then it was time for a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennet) to arrive, to remind Trump of the fact that he wouldn t be president without help from the Russian government, and that he s about to have all of their efforts be for naught. The Ghost of Christmas Future is the best of all, with a positively wickedly delicious version of Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, who gleefully says to Trump: You Donald, have given me the greatest Christmas gift of all!

McFarland admitted in an email to a colleague during the 2016 presidential transition to Russia throwing the election to Trump. The leaked email was written just weeks before Trump s inauguration and it states that sanctions would make it difficult to ease relations with Russia,  which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him. The New York Times reports:But emails among top transition officials, provided or described to The New York Times, suggest that Mr. Flynn was far from a rogue actor. In fact, the emails, coupled with interviews and court documents filed on Friday, showed that Mr. Flynn was in close touch with other senior members of the Trump transition team both before and after he spoke with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about American sanctions against Russia.A White House lawyer tried to explain McFarland s email to the The Times by saying that she was referring to the Democrats  portrayal of the election. That doesn t make any sense, by the way.McFarland wrote the email to Thomas P. Bossert, who currently serves as Trump s homeland security adviser, then he forwarded it to future National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (now indicted), future Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, future senior strategist Stephen Bannon, and future press secretary Sean Spicer, the Daily Beast reports.With all the pearl-clutching we witnessed from conservatives about Hillary Clinton s emails, you d think they wouldn t be sending messages about Russia throwing the election to Trump.This past March, John Oliver, the host of the HBO comedy show Last Week Tonight started a segment called  Stupid Watergate,  which he described as  a scandal with all the potential ramifications of Watergate, but where everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,  he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a  wonderful man. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said in February.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to  let go  of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation.

 Watch This Awesome Mashup of Michael Flynn Leading The ‘Lock Her Up’ Chant As He Goes Off To Court (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has just plead guilty to lying to the FBI   a felony. He has also agreed to testify against Trump in exchange for leniency from Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team. The irony here is beyond delicious   especially since Flynn infamously led the  LOCK HER UP!  chants at the 2016 Republican National Convention, saying that Hillary Clinton was some kind of criminal, and that if Trump was elected they d be able to put her in jail, where many Trump supporters believe she belongs. Well, now the tables are turned, and it is Flynn who will be heading to jail, and the people who realize who the REAL criminals are have been having a field day. Perhaps one of the best pieces of Twitter schaudenfraude is this video of Flynn heading into court to plead guilty with the  Lock her up!  chant being played:I mashed up Michael Flynn s perp walk with audio of him leading a  lock her up  chant. pic.twitter.com/L1o5CjJXrQ  Adam Smith (@asmith83) December 1, 2017This is BEYOND awesome. These fools thought they d get a chance to put Hillary Clinton in jail as if we live in some kind of banana republic. Instead, they are all turning on each other in order to save their own asses in the best circular firing squad any of us ever could have imagined. Michael Flynn is going to sing like a canary so that he can keep himself and his equally criminal son out of federal prison   and railroad the entire Trump crime family into the slammer   just where they belong.The GOP made a deal with the devil when their ignorant, bigoted voters chose this unfit orange overlord to be their presidential nominee. Now, they are very likely to rue the day they ever heard the name Donald Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","December 1, 2017",0
 White House Panics Knowing Flynn Is Going To Take Them Down,"While Donald Trump has been taking vacations, special counsel Robert Mueller has been working hard on the Russia investigation. Instead of golfing this weekend, we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers. Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with Mueller. As part of the plea deal, Flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the Trump transition team to make contact with Russian officials in December. In addition, Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump as a candidate, ordered him to make contacts with the Russians.This marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team Trump and a hostile foreign government.On Friday, just after the news broke, the White House insisted that Flynn s guilty plea will not implicate Trump or anyone else in the White House.The White House said in a statement that Flynn was fired for making false statements to Trump officials, and that he worked for the administration for a short time   and that he was a former Obama administration official. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,  said White House lawyer Ty Cobb.  Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The White House then referred to Flynn as the  former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days  as well as  a former Obama administration official. However, the White House left out a few important details. President Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he also warned Trump about Flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president.On top of that, just after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump called him a  wonderful man  who was treated unfairly by the media.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images.","December 1, 2017",0
 BREAKING: Michael Flynn CRACKS – Will Testify To Mueller Against Trump Himself,"Michael Flynn, Trump s embattled former national security adviser, has reportedly caved in and will testify to Robert Mueller and his team about Trump s collusion with Russia. According to an ABC News special report, Flynn has pleaded guilty to charges that include making false statements to the FBI. Most importantly, he admitted in his plea that officials on Trump s transition team directed his contacts with Russian officials.Furthermore, according to CNN s David Wright on Twitter, there s more to it than that. He s reporting that Brian Ross, who reported for ABC News, said that Flynn also says he s prepared to testify that Trump himself  ordered him, directed him, to make contact with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point. .@BrianRoss reports Michael Flynn  is prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate   Donald Trump   ordered him, directed him, to make contacts with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point.  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017.@BrianRoss:  As well, we re told that Flynn made the decision to cooperate only in the last 24 hours. That he is distraught about this decision, but feels he is doing the right thing for his country     David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017.@BrianRoss:   and that he is facing huge legal bills of more than a million dollars, and he said that finally he had to go and do this for that reason. He expects to put his house on the market. He is facing serious financial problems.  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017For his part, Flynn issued a statement saying the following: Actions I acknowledged in court today are wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions. The White House has said that this is merely more of what got Flynn fired in the first place, and that this will have zero effect on Trump. Har de har har   don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts. Merry Christmas to Donald Trump and his entire treasonous family and administration!

 Trump Gets An Epic F**ck You From Britain Over His White Supremacist Retweets,"Donald Trump has a white supremacy problem, and now it is causing Great Britain, America s closest ally, to rebuke him in an historically public way. After Trump retweeted the leader of Britain First, a fascist white nationalist group, Prime Minister Theresa May decided she had had enough. She publicly criticized Trump, and made it clear that she in no way approved of his identifying with Britain First. May said of Trump s tweets: The fact that we work together does not mean that we re afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them. And I m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do. May went on to call Britain First a  hateful organization  that has caused division in her nation. Now, it seems that a so-called  working visit  that had been planned soon for Trump in Britain will now be cancelled.Trump, of course, instead of trying to patch things up in the  special relationship  that has always existed between the United States and Great Britain, decided to attack the Prime Minister of our closest and most important ally   again, of course, via Twitter:.@Theresa_May, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017Donald Trump is an absolute disgrace. He is shredding America s international relationships, and painting us as a country full of bigoted, knuckle-dragging morons in front of the entire world. No matter who cancelled the visit to the UK for Trump, they were right to do so. The UK s citizens are right to be outraged that this buffoon was set to come to their great nation. Now, if only we Americans could get rid of him in the same way. We can hope.Featured image via Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images","December 1, 2017",0
 This Hilarious Campaign Ad Shows Voters How They Can Avoid Scandalous Elected Officials,"In Michigan, the upcoming election in 2018 presents voters with an interesting option: They could, for the first time, have an all-female  ticket  for every major office being contested. Senator Debbie Stabenow is up for re-election, and odds are good that the nominees for Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State will all be women.At least one of those candidates thinks that s a very good thing. Democratic candidate for AG Dana Nessel has produced a campaign ad that capitalizes on the benefits of being female when it comes to running for public office. Namely, the fact that she doesn t have a d*ck to wave at every passerby.With the wave of allegations over the last few weeks, beginning with the outing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a total pervert and a sexual predator, it seems like everywhere you look there s someone else being ousted from their position or job for having at least acted like a pig   and in some cases the allegations are even worse.Of course, not everyone is suffering from the paradigm shift that has stoked bravery in women across America and around the world. The highest office in the country is, of course, occupied by a man who s been accused by at least 19 women of everything from sexual harassment to actual inappropriate physical touching. And the open US Senate seat in Alabama is currently being contested by, on the Democratic side, the guy who successfully prosecuted the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four young black girls, and on the Republican side, a guy who s accused of pursuing, dating, and touching teenage girls as young as 14 when he was an Assistant District Attorney in his 30 s.Dana Nessel wants to help you avoid all of that unseemly contact with potentially predatory men by simply not being one: [W]hen you re choosing Michigan s next attorney general, ask yourself this: Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting? Is it the candidate who doesn t have a penis? I d say so. Watch the amazing ad here:Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images","November 30, 2017",0
 Joe Scarborough: It’s Not Our Imagination – Trump Really Is Losing His Mind (VIDEO),"People have long speculated about Donald Trump s mental state. While it was once seen as unseemly to suggest that a public figure may be crazy, Trump s alarming behavior warrants an exception   especially since he has the nuclear codes. Well, it s not our imagination   and that s not just because we can see with every wild statement and unhinged Twitter rant that something is wrong with Trump. It s because, according to former Republican Congressman and current host of MSNBC s Morning Joe reported on Thursday that several of Trump s allies confided to him that Trump has dementia.Then, Scarborough went all in, and called for the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, and in doing so, decided to list many of Trump s infamous incidences of con artistry in the process: If this is not what the 25th Amendment was drafted for, I would like the Cabinet members serving America   not the president   you serve America, and you know it. You know you don t serve Donald J. Trump. Scam developer, scam Trump University proprietor, reality TV show host. You don t represent him. You represent 320 million people whose lives are literally in your hands, and we are facing a showdown with a nuclear power. You have somebody inside the White House that the New York Daily News says is mentally unfit. That people close to him say is mentally unfit, that people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia. This is astounding. Joe Scarborough is no liberal. I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he s definitely putting his country before his party, and doing the right thing. It s time for Republicans to stop being cowards and remove Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images","November 30, 2017",0
 Sources Confirm Robert Mueller’s Office Interviewed Jared Kushner Several Weeks Ago,"Jared Kushner, senior White House adviser and son-in-law of President Donald Trump, was interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller s office at the beginning of November, according to a source familiar with the process. As part of an interview that lasted approximately 90 minutes, Kushner was quizzed mainly on his interactions, meetings, and any general contact he had with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, as well as his son, in regards to Flynn s private business dealings with his firm, Flynn Intel Group. Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so,  Kushner s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement given to NBC News.The news of Kushner s interview first came to light when grand jury testimony related to Flynn s private business dealings was postponed by prosecutors working for Mueller, the reason for which is still unclear. This postponement came just a week after Flynn s attorneys alerted President Trump s legal team that information related to the case could no longer be shared between the two parties, nor are they allowed to publicly comment on the matter. It is not uncommon for defense teams to share information, but the practice is considered unethical once a conflict of interest arises, not that Donald Trump has ever been particularly concerned with matters as trivial as  ethics. The fact that Flynn s attorneys are no longer sharing information with Trump s legal team is in no way proof that Flynn is cooperating with the special counsel, but it is a decent sign that he is working with them, but Trump s team has been expecting this for quite some time. It is probably a plea deal,  Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trump s legal team, told CBS News earlier in the month.  That is the assumption. And if it is a plea that doesn t necessarily mean it has anything to do with the president. The Manafort indictment didn t have anything to do with the campaign or Trump. Michael Flynn served as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency until he was fired from the position in 2014 by former President Barack Obama, however, he still retained a security clearance, even during Trump s presidential campaign and transition into the White House until Flynn s role was terminated 23 days into Trump s presidency. Any possible cooperation Flynn has with the prosecution could give Mueller s counsel insight into the Trump campaign s operations and potential dealings with Russia, as well as the first few weeks of his presidency.The FBI is already looking into both Flynn s Trump lobbying and Flynn Intel Group s research work for an unfinished film for which the firm was paid $530,000 by a Turkish businessman. Employees of Sphere Consulting, who did public relations work on the film, have been turning over documents requested by Mueller s investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews for several months.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images","November 30, 2017",0
 Trump Sends Crazy-Time Tweet To The Wrong Account After Losing His Sh*t Over World Leader’s Remarks,"Donald Trump retweeted fake news videos in the early hours of the morning and for that, he was widely condemned. The White House responded to say that it doesn t matter if the former reality show star posted fake videos about Muslims because  the threat is real!  Scary, huh? A backlash ensued after Trump retweeted three times from a woman who was convicted of a hate crime in the U.K.The current occupant of the White House is upset because British Prime Minister Theresa May responded to Trump s widely condemned retweets this morning, saying,  It is wrong for the president to have done this.  In a statement, Downing street further said,  Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. Members of British Parliament also condemned Trump s retweets.So naturally, Trump lashed out on Twitter at our ally s leader. The problem is that he tweeted to the wrong Theresa May, a person who only has 6 followers, causing that Twitter user to receive nearly 9,000 notifications.We took a screen capture because we knew (and he did) the Dotard would delete it. Here s Trump s full tweet to the totally wrong person. Finally, Trump tweeted the correct Theresa May, writing the same message:  Don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

 Americans Once Elected A President After He Was Accused Of Raping A 13-Year-Old Girl,"After an awful campaign filled with hateful rhetoric, American voters elected a man to lead the most powerful country on earth even after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old. The year was 2016 and the accused was an alleged billionaire, former reality show star and an admitted sexual predator. Still, even after the revelations, conservatives saw nothing wrong with Donald Trump s behavior. The plaintiff described the horrifying incident in which Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein allegedly raped a child. A lawsuit was filed which claims that threats were made in order for the victim to keep her mouth shut about what had just happened.Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability, and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.There was a witness who backed up  Jane Doe s  claims. According to the lawsuit, Trump and Epstein  sexually and physically  abused the then 13-year-old plaintiff and forced her  to engage in various perverted and depraved sex acts    including being  forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm,  and being  forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe, age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump    after luring her to a  series of underage sex parties  by promising her  money and a modeling career,  according to Snopes.Trump has admitted knowing Epstein for 15 years. Epstein was named in multiple similar lawsuits, served 13 months in jail, and is registered as a sex offender for life.The lawsuit which was filed in California on April 26, 2016, was dismissed over technical filing errors and it was refiled in June of the same year, then dropped again in November after the plaintiff received death threats.Last year, Trump was also accused by 16 women of sexually harassing or assaulting them. Conservatives went on to elect him knowing full well that he is a sexual predator because he said so in the Access Hollywood tape.History will not be kind as it remembers November of 2016.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.","November 29, 2017",0
" Trump’s Biggest KKK Fan Is Back, And He Just LOVED Those Anti-Muslim Tweets This Morning","Just in case you needed any more proof that Donald Trump s racist tweets were a thinly-coded message to his alt-right, anti-Muslim, and white supremacist followers, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK has jumped on board today in praise of President Hates-a-Lot.It wasn t enough that the KKK endorsed Trump during his campaign to stop his multitudes of followers from voting for him, so it s hard to say whether Duke s full-throated endorsement of today s disgusting display of racism will be any different. But for the average American, seeing the former Klan leader get behind Trump so vigorously should make them more than a little sick.To even go to Duke s page on Twitter is to subject yourself to a blinding cover photo, all white, with a blue-eyed  Aryan  baby in the upper corner, and the words  It s Okay To Be White  across the middle. The phrase is part of a hate campaign that  Doctor  Duke has been pushing across America, a play on the notion that there is some kind of war on white people happening.But the tweet itself is disturbing:Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death, He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T. Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 29, 2017By invoking God in his message, Duke is trying the age-old tactic of pretending that white supremacy has its roots in Christianity, an angle that KKK members have tried to use for generations.Sadly, it works on some followers of both Duke s and of Donald Trump s. It seems there s quite a bit of crossover between the two racist groups. That s no surprise: The KKK were absolutely instrumental in getting Trump elected.The bottom line is, both men know exactly what they re doing when they send messages like that to their followers. Trump s racist retweets were already disgraceful enough. But continuing to leave them on his Twitter feed even after seeing praise from a Loyal White Knight like David Duke is just rubbing salt in the wound.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images","November 29, 2017",0

 Democrats Give Trump A Big F**ck You After He Attacks Them In Insane Twitter Rant,"Donald Trump s Twitter feed is always a goldmine of crazy. Unfortunately, since the orange overlord is now squatting in the Oval Office, those nutty tweets tend to have the ability to derail important policy initiatives, and can therefore have disastrous effects for the nation and sometimes the world. Case in point   the fact that he insisted upon attacking Democratic leaders that he had a meeting with regarding the debt ceiling, the Children s Health Insurance Program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and other important domestic policy initiatives. Apparently, Trump saw fit to take to Twitter to accuse his old pals  Chuck and Nancy  of not being strong enough on crime and immigration, and therefore doesn t see a way to make deals with them:Meeting with  Chuck and Nancy  today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don t see a deal!  Donald J.

 Trump Wakes Up To Scream At Black People After Hurling A Racial Slur Yesterday,"Donald Trump thinks if he rage-tweets about NFL players who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem as a form of silent protest against racial injustice and police brutality, it will all go away but by doing that, he inadvertently highlights that there is a problem.

As for his ratings, he ranks as the least popular president in the history of polling.Donald Trump is actively trying to divide our country even more than it already is.

 Trump Supporters Object To Prince Harry’s Recent Engagement For Terrible Reasons (TWEETS),"Great Britain s Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Prince Harry, the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales, had gotten engaged. A royal engagement is always big news in the United Kingdom, but this one also hit home in the United States too, because Harry s now-fiance is American actress Meghan Markle, best known for her roles as Rachel Zane in the legal drama series Suits, as well as special agent Amy Jessup in the sci-fi thriller Fringe.The British royal family no longer holds anywhere near as much clout as it once did, now essentially relegated to mere tabloid fodder, but while many were expressing their happiness online for one of the Windsor s most beloved members, quite a few Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction at the prince s choice. You see, Markle is biracial, her father being Caucasian and her mother African-American, and in the minds of many deplorables, this is a bad thing.It s completely irrelevant that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of the reigning Queen Elizabeth II, is half-Greek, because that is pretty much white. However, when news broke of Prince Harry s engagement to Markle, white supremacists from across the United States and around the globe took to Twitter, because in their twisted minds, disturbing the racial purity of the British royal family is not a good thing, despite the fact the fact it has been going on for centuries. Here is but a mere sample:It's all smiles on TV but in private the #QUEEN is figuring out how to stop #PrinceHarry from destroying the #royalbloodline with mixed race #royalwedding #godsavethequeen $fb $twtr $goog #MAGA  $PENNY KING (@groman100) November 27, 2017Totally unsuitable as a Royal bride.

That s right, Prince Harry has made it quite clear that President Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding, despite the bride being a United States citizen. Barack and Michelle Obama, on the other hand, will more than likely be welcomed with open arms.Both Harry and especially his mother, Princess Diana, are well-known for their humanitarian work and according to a close source, the prince is  not a fan  of Trump.  Harry thinks the president is a serious threat to human rights,  the source continued, but there might be a lot more to it than just that.When Princess Diana split from her husband, Prince Charles, in 1992, a palace aide claims that Trump was  relentless  in his pursuit of Diana, a claim backed up by British TV journalist and friend of the princess, Selina Scott. Scott said that Trump bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers,  adding that he gave Diana  the creeps,  a fact Trump representatives obviously deny. Then there were these tweets from Donald Trump when Princess Kate Middleton, wife of Harry s brother, Prince William, was illegally photographed by paparazzi sunbathing topless in her backyard in 2012:Kate Middleton is great but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude only herself to blame.

" While Honoring Native American Code Talkers, Trump Called Elizabeth Warren ‘Pocahontas’ (VIDEO)","Former reality show star Donald Trump just can t stop using a slur to describe Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) but this time he took things to the edge then crossed the line. On Monday, Trump referred to Warren as  Pocahontas  at an event honoring Native American  code talkers  who fought in World War II. Trump was literally surrounded by Native Americans when he hurled the slur. The chief. He s the general and the chief,  Trump said during the White House event, in reference to White House chief of staff John Kelly.  I said, how good were these code talkers? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were, what they have done for this country and the strength and the bravery and the love for the country. So that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance,  Trump continued.  And I just want to thank you because you re very, very special people. You were here long before any of us were here, although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago, they call her Pocahontas.

 Pro-Trump Group Is Now Using Pictures Of An Obama Rally To Make Trump Look Popular,"In their pathetic attempt to pass the deeply unpopular and unfair tax bill that Republicans in Congress have been working on, the GOP has pulled out all the stops   and so have outside spending groups.Every campaign season, America is inundated with ad after ad claiming that one candidate or the other will be either the nation s savior or its downfall. But when ads start popping up for legislation, you know the party that s pushing it is desperate for support.America First Policies, a pro-Trump organization that calls itself a non-profit just because they legally can, has come up with a new ad intended to convince Americans to call their members of Congress and demand that they vote yes on the upcoming tax nightmare. We know it s a nightmare because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office just scored the bill on Sunday night, and said that the legislation, which has had ZERO hearings, raises taxes on the poor, cuts taxes on the rich, and cripples Obamacare by repealing the individual mandate that makes the system function.The ad is a clever bit of doublespeak itself, as is everything that Republicans say when it comes to taxes. They have promoted the utterly debunked theory of  trickle-down  economics for more than three decades, and for all of their posturing, not a single dime of tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy has ever  trickled down  in the form of economic stimulus or higher pay for workers   as they perennially promise that it will.But it s an image that AFP uses in the ad that s catching people s attention.Watch the ad and see if you catch something that looks familiar:Check out our NEW TV ADThis is our once in a generation opportunity to CUT TAXES for the Middle Class.

 Breitbart Editor To CNN Host: A Song By Ringo Starr Proves Roy Moore Isn’t A Pedo (VIDEO),"A Breitbart News editor tried to use a song Ringo Starr covered in order to make claims appear to be false that controversial Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his thirties. On Monday, Breitbart editor Joel Pollak told host Chris Cuomo on CNN s  New Day  that Starr released  You re Sixteen (You re Beautiful, You re Mine),  a cover of a song that was actually written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman and performed by Johnny Burnette. The song was also featured in  American Graffiti. He was 30-something at the time singing about a 16-year-old,  Pollak said.  You want to take away Ringo Starr s achievement? You can t be serious,  Cuomo shot back.  I m dead serious. You think that Ringo Starr s song is supposed to be a nod toward allowing 30-year-olds to prey on teenagers? You don t believe that, Joel. You re a parent. You don t believe that. Watch:Breitbart senior editor defends Judge Roy Moore citing Ringo Starr's hit cover of the song ""You're Sixteen You're Beautiful (And You're Mine)"" https://t.co/tmwxLROJCk  New Day (@NewDay) November 27, 2017Pollack previously claimed that Moore creeping up on high school girls was  perfectly legitimate  because the age of consent is 16-years-old in Alabama. He said it wasn t  accurate  to claim that the teenage girls were teenagers because one of them was 16 and the other was 18, both of which would be considered   wait for it   teenage years.Moore, by the way, has been accused of pursuing relationships with girls as young as 14-years-old when he was in his 30s. Moore was also banned from the Gadsden Mall and the YMCA for perving on teenage girls. A police officer was assigned to the job of making sure Moore stayed away from high school ballgames to be sure he didn t bother the cheerleaders.Someone should check Pollak s browsing history. Just a thought. In fact, check Donald Trump s, too, since he s come out strong in support of Roy Moore.Image via screen capture. ","November 27, 2017",0
 Former Obama Photographer Takes Trolling Trump To A Whole New Level (TWEETS),"By now you would most likely be familiar with the story of President Trump taking a pass at being named Time Magazine s Person of the Year, a rather prestigious honor that Trump has a bizarre fixation with and one that is highly unlikely to be bestowed upon him again any time in the near future following his nomination last year.For those of you not in the know, Donald Trump tried to claim on Friday that he turned down the chance to be selected as Time s  Person of the Year,  as he would be required to give an interview and do a photo shoot. Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named  Man (Person) of the Year,  like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!  Trump tweeted.Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named  Man (Person) of the Year,  like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017The only flaw with the President s claim was that not a single word of it was remotely true and he was called on it too, first by Time magazine, who were quick to point out that that s not how the selection or announcement process even works, something Trump should already be aware of, and then by Time s chief content officer, Alan Murray, who tweeted that none of what the President had tweeted was at all factual.The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year.

Souza shared a compilation of images consisting of 15 Time covers featuring the Obamas, originally posted by an account by the name of @michelleandbarack.

" Just Back From A Golfing Vacay, Trump Says He’s Done More Than Any President Ever","Donald Trump just got back from binge-golfing over a span of five days and he s on track to triple the time former President Barack Obama spent on the golf course in his first year in office even though he repeatedly disparaged his predecessor for golfing. There are at least 27 tweets which Trump unleashed about Obama golfing, and on the campaign trail, he continued that.  If I were in the White House   I don t think I d ever see any of the places that I [own],  Trump said during the campaign just last year, citing one of his golf courses in Florida.

" Two Weeks Before Election, Trump Still Defends Accused Child Molester Because TAXES, Y’all","Sunday morning, after what must have seemed like another interminable weekend of scrutiny, terror, and being made to look like a fool, Donald Trump returned to doing what he does best: Being an absolute garbage person. He was still recovering from the humiliation of his hilariously bad attempt at pretending TIME Magazine  offered  him their Person of the Year honorific, followed by the embarrassment of trying to troll CNN, only to see their response tweet get twice the likes and retweets of his original.So Trump had to up his game. And how could he possibly piss off more people than by pivoting back to Roy Moore, the accused pedophile running for the US Senate in Alabama?Even some of Trump s most ardent supporters have begged the Doddering Dotard to back off his support for the toxic candidate. It s hard, as you might imagine, to truly get behind a guy who s accused of molesting young girls, especially with so much evidence against him. But Trump tried nonetheless:The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn t enough. Can t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017It s an interesting tack to take   just talking about how terrible Doug Jones is, rather than addressing the fact that Roy Moore is accused of touching children inappropriately. What s more interesting is how wrong he is on every count. Weak on crime? Jones successfully prosecuted the KKK members who blew up a Birmingham church, killing four young black girls in 1963. The Second Amendment? The most Jones supports as far as gun control is expanded background checks. Bad for the military? Jones supports increased military spending, a position that puts him at odds with the two lawmakers that Trump tries to  tie  Jones to in his tweets. Jones is largely considered a moderate among Democrats.The bottom line is, Trump is terrified of losing a crucial vote on his signature tax cuts for the wealthy. He is so calculating that if he didn t have something so important pending, he would throw Roy Moore under the bus in a heartbeat   despite the similarities between accusations against Moore and accusations against himself.This is the worst of politics, people. And when the Republican Party is bloodied on the floor of America, they can thank their garbage president who refused to back away from a child molester just because he wants to  accomplish  something before he s booted out of office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","November 26, 2017",0
 Principles Over Power: Why Republicans Need To Do What’s Right To Remain Relevant,"Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years.

 Trump: Everything You Heard Me Say On The Access Hollywood Tape Never Happened,"Former reality show star Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to be held responsible for the words that come out of his own mouth, even when it s on tape. For example, the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which he suggests that because he s powerful, he can just grab women by their p-ssies. Trump defended sexual harasser and Fox News host (yeah, I know that s redundant) Bill O Reilly in the recent past and even more recently, he has defended alleged pedophile and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. So, defending perverts is just another day for Donald Trump.Here s a quick reminder of what Trump said on the p*ssy grabbing tape: You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]   I just start kissing them. It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. The New York Times reports that even after Trump made an almost-apology after the tape was revealed, he still told a Senator and an adviser that the Access Hollywood tape may not be authentic.But something deeper has been consuming Mr. Trump. He sees the calls for Mr. Moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now-famous  Access Hollywood  tape, in which he boasted about grabbing women s genitalia, and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after. He suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic, and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently.So, to reiterate, Trump told an adviser recently that the video and tape of him talking about perving on women is fake news. And he also told that to a Senator after it was released.We see a pattern here. Maybe Trump s cult-like following will believe this crap but the rest of us remember that tape all too well. That tape was an indicating factor that Donald J. Trump is unfit for office, morally and intellectually.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","November 25, 2017",0

Now, he s back at it   this time suggesting that  fake  CNN should be the ones representing America to the world, and that they are doing a bad job. Here is that tweet:.@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!  Donald J.

" Gay GOP Operative Endorses Doug Jones Over ‘Bigoted, Deviant’ Roy Moore In Senate Race (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has a Roy Moore problem. Even before it came out that the judge turned Alabama Senate candidate is accused of being a child molester, he was a problem. He had been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for flagrantly defying the law. Moore has said Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He waved a gun around on stage at a campaign rally and rode a horse to the polls in Alabama to vote for himself in the primary he would eventually win against establishment-backed interim Senator Luther Strange. Well, it seems that with all of this and then some, sane Republicans have had enough of Roy Moore. One such person is former Jeb Bush campaign strategist Tim Miller. He  has a solution to his party s Roy Moore problem: Vote for the Democrat, Doug Jones, to keep Roy Moore the hell away from the United States Senate.Miller happens to be gay, so of course Moore s disgusting homophobia is a problem for him. Then there is, of course, the child molesting. In a column for the left-wing site Crooked Media entitled  The Republican Case for Doug Jones,  Miller says of his decision, which he calls,  obvious : But here we are in the dark abyss of 2017, and in this political moment, child exploitation attempted child rape, even has become a partisan issue. President Donald Trump is even cool with it, as long as the sex predator is on his team. A comrade in genital grabbing if you will. So after Trump essentially re-endorsed Alabama s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, this particular child predator, on Tuesday, I took what I thought was an obvious step. I donated to the other guy s campaign. But in this instance there was one wrinkle for me. The other guy, Doug Jones, is a Democrat. And I a Republican political operative have never donated to one of those before. Thus, in sharing the fact that I had made the donation on social media, I also noted that this was a first for me, even though it felt extremely obvious. Here is the tweet where Tim Miller announces his crossover:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017Tim Miller is right. Roy Moore is absolutely deplorable, and should be nowhere near the United States Senate. This isn t politics, it s morals. Now, it is time for more sane, reasonable Republicans to get out there and do the unthinkable   reject a child molester and endorse and donate to the man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan while Roy Moore was busy creeping on little girls. It s not that hard.Watch the video of Tim Miller s appearance on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images","November 23, 2017",0
 WATCH: Retired Alabama Cop: We Were Told To Keep Roy Moore Away From High School Cheerleaders,"It seems that Republican candidate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions  vacated Senate seat Roy Moore s proclivity for teenage girls was well known decades ago in Gadsden, Alabama   even within the courthouse where he worked as an Assistant District Attorney, and even within the police department. Retired police officer Faye Gary spoke with MSNBC and said of the situation: The rumor mill was that he liked young girls, and   we were advised that he was being suspended from the mall because he would hang around the young girls that worked in the stores and   really got into a place of where they say he was harassing. We were also told to watch him at the ball games, and make sure that   he didn t hang around the cheerleaders. Faye Gary went on to say that she originally thought that Moore liked, perhaps, women in their 20 s   you know, LEGAL younger women. But, no. It was actually teenagers the old creep liked. Gary also said that Moore s liking for little girls   was a known fact,  while speaking with the New York Times, going on to say,  It was treated like a joke. That s just the way it was. Of course, Roy Moore has long been a controversial character. He was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice, both times refusing to follow the law. The first time it was over his refusal to removed a 5,000+ pound monument of the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court building, and the second time for ordering officials around the state to refuse to comply with the United States Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality nation wide. He has also said that Representative Keith Ellison should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he is a Muslim. In other words, this is a man who has no regard for the rule of law, and is likely a child molester to boot.In short, the voters of Alabama need to reject this bigoted extremist, and, if they don t, they ll be sending a message to the rest of the nation: a child molester is much better to be seated in the Senate than a Democrat.Watch Faye Gary s comments on the matter below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images","November 22, 2017",0
 New York Times Reports There’s An Actual Russian Agent In Congress And He Has A Code Name,"More than a year ago, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was caught *oops* on a hot mic saying that there were two people in Washington who were being paid by the Russians   Donald Trump and California GOP. Rep Dana Rohrabacher. Sadly, those two people are still in office.A new report by the New York Times, though, confirms half of McCarthy s comments. Rohrabacher isn t just being paid by the Russians, he s a Russian agent, and he has a code name, and it s not even new information.According to the Times report, the FBI warned Rohrbacher in 2012 that the Russians viewed him as a source and had given him a code name. The next year, Congress elevated him to the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that overseas Russian policy. Nope, nothing at all fishy there.Rohrabacher didn t seem to have much involvement in the Trump campaign (that would be too obvious, even for the Russians), but Special Investigator Robert Mueller is eyeing him nonetheless:As revelations of Russia s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump s short-lived national security adviser.Rohrabacher s Russian connections go back further than just a few years, though. As a young Reaganite, he got the warm fuzzies with the fall of the Soviet Union and he developed a relationship with Vladimir Putin. In the 90s, Rohrabacher lost an arm wrestling match to the man who would become President for life, or whatever the hell Putin calls himself.Rohrabacher, naturally, denies that he is a Russian agent:Mr. Rohrabacher has laughed off suggestions that he is a Russian asset, and said in an interview that he did not remember being briefed that the Russians viewed him as a source. The F.B.I. and the senior members of the House Intelligence Committee sat Mr. Rohrabacher down in the Capitol in 2012 to warn him that Russian spies were trying to recruit him, according to two former intelligence officials. I remember them telling me,  You have been targeted to be recruited as an agent,  he said.  How stupid is that? Only, his actions paint a very different picture. In 2016, he served as what might be called a delivery boy between Russia and either the Trump campaign or the RNC. He picked up a memo targeting Democratic donors. Rohrabacher has also met with Wikileaks  Julian Assange and Russian (accused criminal) oligarchs.Rohrabacher insists nothing untoward is going on. His goal, he says, is to bring Russia in to help us battle terrorism. To be fair, Russia could help rein in terrorism, but they would have to stop funding terrorists, like Syrian President Bashir Assad.Republicans are finding it a bit easier to distance themselves from Rohrabacher than the other alleged Russian agent, Donald Trump. They are limiting his power on the Foreign Affairs committee.Politically, this could be disaster for Rohrabacher. He s facing a tough race in California, and you d better believe that his opponents are using his Russian connections against him.Hans Keirstead, a prominent stem-cell researcher competing with five other Democrats to challenge Mr. Rohrabacher, compared the Republican s Russia record to  a prologue to a very bad book. We ve got a Russian-tainted congressman,  Mr. Keirstead said in an interview, adding  Why should the constituents of the 48th District vote for an individual whose interests are elsewhere? Of course, Rohrabacher, like anyone who s been trained in dictator 101, is fundraising off of it, calling it an  attack. Featured image via Adam Berry/Getty Images.","November 22, 2017",0
 Fox News Bans Gene Simmons For Life For Harassing Staff Off Camera,"Gene Simmons, the 68-year-old Kiss bassist and co-lead singer, contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice for a grand total of three episodes back in 2008, self-proclaimed womanizer, and all-around poster-boy for washed up, aging rock stars who will stop at nothing to keep their names in the rapidly-diminishing spotlight, has stooped to a new low in his battle against irrelevancy   He has been given a lifetime ban from Fox News.When it comes to Fox News, the network has a tendency to be a little lenient on the issue of behavior of sexual nature, a reputation that screams  Hold my beer!  to a man like Gene Simmons. On what was far from his first appearance on the network, Simmons was a guest last Wednesday on Fox and Friends, as well as Fox Business Network s Mornings With Maria, to promote his new book, On Power. Gene Simmons, who claims to know Donald Trump  very well  and that the current President s critics should  get over it,  couldn t be faulted for his onscreen appearance, even helping with the weather report:MUST SEE: @genesimmons helps @JaniceDean with the weather! pic.twitter.com/EFfRQESNuq  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) November 15, 2017Simmons also sat on a panel with Mornings With Maria host Maria Bartiromo and gave his view on the Harvey Weinstein sexual-misconduct case. The lunatics have taken over the insane asylum when respected business entities such as yourself ask guys that like to stick their tongues out what I think of Harvey Weinstein,  Simmons answered.  Okay, I m a powerful and attractive man, and what I m about to say is deadly serious,  he added.  Men are jackasses. From the time we re young we have testosterone. I m not validating it or defending it. As is always the case, however, it was when the cameras weren t rolling that things began to get creepy and also quite hypocritical. According to a knowledgeable Fox News source, Simmons arrived on the studio s fourteenth floor to do an interview with FoxNews.com s entertainment section to promote his book, but also chose to walk into a staff meeting uninvited, opened his shirt and shouted,  Hey chicks, sue me! He didn t stop there, though. The source claims he went on to tell pedophilia-related Michael Jackson jokes, hit two employees on the head with his book while making comparisons on their intelligence based on the sounds, and asked an African-American employee if he was Al Roker.  It was pretty severe,  the source said.Simmons  behavior was reported to a supervisor, who in turn passed the news on to Fox News human-resources executive Kevin Lord, who promptly banned Simmons from the building. He was also permanently barred from appearing on any Fox News or Fox Business Networkprogramming.It seems that Gene Simmons may have had a change of heart over the past week, as he has released the following statement: I have appeared frequently over the years on various Fox News and Fox Business programs and have a tremendous amount of respect for the talented women and men who work there. While I believe that what is being reported is highly exaggerated and misleading, I am sincerely sorry that I unintentionally offended members of the Fox team during my visit. Although Simmons  interview with FoxNews.com was recorded, it will not be released.Featured image via Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images","November 22, 2017",0
 WATCH: Nicolle Wallace Takes Trump To The Woodshed For Backing Pedophile Moore,"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Nicolle Wallace for endorsing an accused child molester.Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of sexual assault by several women, most of whom were teens at the time. One woman was 14-years-old.Age of consent laws apparently did not matter to Moore, who was the district attorney during the time period in which most of the assaults allegedly occurred. Moore own former colleagues have confirmed that Moore preyed upon teenage girls and he was even banned from a shopping mall because he kept creeping on teen girls.On Tuesday, Trump finally spoke out about Moore and the allegations. And what he said was sickening.Trump accused Moore s opponent Doug Jones of being  soft  on crime before saying he d rather have an accused child molester in the Senate instead of a Democrat. Then he defended Moore the same way he defended Vladimir Putin during his trip to Asia. Well, he denies it, Trump said.  Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn t happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. Trump s words were so disgusting that MSNBC s Nicolle Wallace took him to the woodshed. I have this physical feeling of just being repulsed listening to   be it a figure head, he is the head of the Republican Party and I have described myself as a nonpracticing member, but I don t know what other word to use other than repulsed, that the head of the Republican Party said essentially threw his weight behind someone accused of stalking and engaging in sexual activity with a 14-year-old. There s nothing normal about throwing your weight behind a child molester. So when he says, this president says  he denies it, he denies it  I almost heard in him,  I denied it too.  He s almost projecting on to Roy Moore his own circumstance. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Trump was accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women during the campaign. He called all of them liars at the time. And it looks like that s coming back to bite Trump on the ass.Featured Image: Screenshot","November 21, 2017",0
 Pastor Goes Full Y’all Qaeda Defending Roy Moore: He Only Wanted Teen Girls For Their ‘Purity’,"A pastor who appeared alongside Senate candidate Roy Moore at a campaign rally just days ago just gave a defense of the Alabama Senate candidate that makes Christian purity balls seem even creepier. Flip Benham has quite a history as an anti-gay pastor who was also convicted of stalking a doctor who performed abortion procedures in North Carolina. In reaction to that in 2011, Benham said outside the courtroom while holding a Bible, I can t speak. I can t get within 500 feet. They ve stolen from innocent babies a voice that has spoken for them. Well, that whole pro-life platform of his sure did change since then and his defense of Roy Moore, the twice-removed judge who has been accused of perving on teenage girls when he was 32-years-old, is not going to help the Alabama Republican.The right-wing pastor explained that Moore dated teen girls because of their  purity  and said that when he got back from Vietnam there weren t any women his age left to date.So, pedophilia, right?On Monday, Benham told a local Alabama radio show that there was nothing wrong with Moore dating teenage girls. I think that, number one, you need to understand, 40 years ago, what the Sitz im Leben was like in Alabama,  Benham said, as reported by Right Wing Watch.  Judge Roy Moore graduated from West Point and then went on into the service, served in Vietnam and then came back and was in law school. All of the ladies, or many of the ladies that he possibly could have married were not available then, they were already married, maybe, somewhere. So he looked in a different direction and always with the [permission of the] parents of younger ladies   He did that because there is something about a purity of a young woman, there is something that is good, that s true, that s straight and he looked for that. Listen to the whole thing below:We re thinking that someone should check into Pastor Flip Benham s browsing history. Benham s words aren t going to help Moore.

 Trump’s National Security Adviser Reportedly TRASHED Him – This Is Epic,"Add Trump s national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, to the growing list of high-profile people who think he s a total buffoon. McMaster, a seasoned combat officer in the Army, is reportedly fed up with Trump s lack of intelligence, lack of focus, and inability to understand even the most basic premises of national security.According to several Buzzfeed sources, McMaster was attending a private dinner with Oracle CEO Safra Catz, and dragged Trump through the mud, calling him an  idiot,  a  dope,  and someone with the intelligence of  a kindergartner.  Another source who wasn t at the dinner told Buzzfeed that McMaster has made similar comments before.Recently, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a moron, prompting the man-baby to jump on Twitter and challenge Tillerson to an IQ test. Trump either knows exactly what he is and is riddled with self-loathing and embarrassment over it, or he honestly believes he has one of the great minds and memories of all time, just like he s claimed, and his fragile fee-fees can t handle anyone thinking otherwise.Then there s Senator Bob Corker, who s had no qualms at all about criticizing Trump, which led the two of them into a Twitter war because Trump can t stand looking like the pathetic, ineffective pseudo-man that he is. And we all know how Senator Jeff Flake feels.Officials who are on Trump s side, however, push back against all these things vehemently. From their stories, everything is hunky-dory in the White House, and Trump is highly competent, calm, collected, respected   in short, presidential. Anyone inside or outside the White House talking badly about him is just, well, jealous ? Or un-American ? To them, these stories are nothing more than people deliberately working to undermine Trump, at least in the world Trump and his loyalists are desperate to create.These stories keep coming out, though, and when taken with his embarrassing public appearances and his ridiculous behavior on Twitter, they are ever harder to ignore. Buzzfeed has five sources for McMaster s words, with a sixth saying they d heard similar words from him before.This dinner between McMaster and Catz took place over the summer, and was allegedly peppered with insults toward Trump and other senior members of the White House staff, including Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. McMaster reportedly (and, if true, correctly) said that Kushner doesn t belong in the White House and shouldn t be involved in national security matters.In short, Trump doesn t have the respect he thinks he has.

 Trump’s Favorite News Channel Tries To Soothe His Battered Ego – Gets Taken To The Cleaners,"Yesterday, after the father of one of the UCLA players arrested in China failed to show Trump proper gratitude for getting his kid released, Trump, predictably, went to Twitter to grouse about it. He seems to expect to be worshiped for his help on this matter, but LaVar Ball wouldn t do it, so Trump tweeted:Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017Fox News put that tweet into a meme portraying Trump as a strong, decisive leader and the UCLA basketball players as weaklings, because of course they did. Then they asked:  Do you agree with President Trump? Yes.

 Texas Governor Just Broke With Trump; This Is Unprecedented,"Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked. Maybe we would have a different leader who has the ability to deal with critical issues. Wait, they were warned, weren t they?Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.","November 19, 2017",0
 Conservative ‘Christian’ Leader Kept A Sexual Assault Secret For A Republican Lawmaker,"Conservatives should shun Tony Perkins for this.Earlier this week, Ohio GOP state Rep. Wes Goodman was busted for carrying on a same-sex affair in his taxpayer funded office, forcing him to tender his resignation.But there is an even worse transgression in Goodman s past, one that should drag the Family Research Council leader to hell with him.As it turns out, Goodman once fondled an 18-year-old without consent in his hotel room at the Ritz Carlton in Washington D.C.The teen s stepfather was quick to alert Perkins of the incident via email, warning him that continuing to endorse Goodman would be a mistake. If we endorse these types of individuals, then it would seem our whole weekend together was nothing more than a charade,  the teen s stepfather wrote. Trust me,  Perkins replied.  This will not be ignored nor swept aside. It will be dealt with swiftly, but with prudence. Perkins withdrew his support and suspended Goodman from the Council for National Policy. Going forward so soon, without some distance from your past behavior and a track record of recovery, carries great risk for you and for those who are supporting you,  Perkins wrote to Goodman.But Perkins failed to report the crime to law enforcement. Instead, he kept quiet and allowed a sexual predator to gain public office. In fact, even the board members of the Council for National Policy knew about the crime because Perkins informed them, and none of them did a damn thing about it.And this all happened just two years ago in 2015. Surely, Perkins and the board members he told can still be prosecuted for failing to report Goodman to the authorities.Because they definitely should be.Featured Image: Wikimedia","November 18, 2017",0
 GOP Senator Caught On Hot Mic Trashing His Own Party Over Roy Moore And Donald Trump (VIDEO)," Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) is liberated now that he has announced his retirement. In his resignation speech on the Senate floor, Flake issued a scathing takedown of Trump, and it seems his views have not changed. At a town hall on tax reform, Flake was caught on a hot mic while he was chatting with the mayor of Mesa, Arizona, fellow Republican John Giles. Flake said of extremist candidates and officials like Alabama Senate candidate and alleged pedophile Roy Moore, and the current  president  Donald Trump: If we become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast. Giles responded: And I am not throwing smoke at you, but you are the guy. Just for fun, think about how much fun it would be, just to be the foil, you know, and point out what an idiot this guy [Trump] is. Giles then encourages Flake to  foil  the  idiot  Trump in 2020, and the two continue yucking it up about how ridiculous the kinds of people who are emerging as the face of their party are. It took a staffer reminding Flake of the mic to stop the conversation, but we ve certainly heard enough to know where he stands on the current state of the GOP.So, in other words, Jeff Flake, who is one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, is fed up with the extremism in the GOP. He clearly thinks people like Roy Moore and Donald Trump have zero business being anywhere near the levers of power, and yet here we are. Trump is in the Oval Office, and Moore is a heartbeat away from being seated in the United States Senate.Watch the comments below:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images","November 18, 2017",0
 Donald Trump Is Destroying The Country’s Reputation And Here’s Proof,"During the election, when Donald Trump wasn t bellowing  Lock her up  about Hillary Clinton, he was manufacturing a narrative in which President Obama had turned our country into a dystopia in which we ve lost all respectability throughout the world.We need a President who isn't a laughing stock to the entire World. We need a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning. Respect!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2014  As usual, Trump was more about projection than the truth. We can t be sure if he knew he was going to destroy our reputation around the world, but he did. In a survey released on Thursday, our standing in the world tumbled all the way from number one to number six. The power and quality of each country s  brand image  was measured by the Nation Brands Index (NBI) survey, which was conducted by German-based market research firm GfK and British political consultant Simon Anholt. The final NBI score was decided after collecting public opinion on 50 different countries on primarily six categories: its  people,   governance,   exports,   tourism,   investment and immigration,  and  culture and heritage. According to popular public opinion, the U.S. dropped to the sixth place while Germany rose to claim the prestigious first spot. Germany stood second in the same survey last year while the first place was held by the U.S. After just a year, the U.S. is lagging behind Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Japan.Source: IBTimesThis isn t the first time the world has taken notice of the fact that we have a greedy, uncivilized, unethical half-wit at the helm of the largest economy and the largest military in the world.In September, a Pew poll found that the world favored Obama over Trump by a significant number. Out of 37 countries, only two liked Trump better. Only Russia (hmmmm) and Israel were happier with Trump. As for the rest of the world, the drop in popularity wasn t just in double digits, it was, as Trump might say, huuuuge! Only 10 percent of Swedes trust Trump not to start World War III. 93 percent of Swedish people trusted Obama. Okay, the survey didn t specify World War but it did ask if they trusted the U.S. president to handle world affairs.The rest of the world wasn t quite as dramatic, but as you can see from this chart below, the world really hates Trump.In July, his results were somewhat better, but he was still wildly hated by the majority of the world s citizens.This is a lot bigger deal than just a few statistics. It took a long time to build our standing in the world. Since World War II, right or wrong, the United States has been seen as a moral leader. We are certainly an economic leader. Now we have no leg to stand on, even when fighting for own interests. We may be witnessing the death of the world s longest living democracy and it s all because millions of people threw a temper tantrum over the fact that a black man was president and that a woman wanted to be president.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.","November 17, 2017",0
 Trump Just Got His P*ssy Handed To Him By New Zealand’s Female Prime Minister,"Donald Trump bit off a bit more than he could chew when he attempted to shoot some venom at New Zealand s newly-elected Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during their first in-person meeting at the East Asia Summit last week.When Trump told her that her victory had  upset  citizens in her country, she hit back and his oranges testes shriveled up instantly. This lady caused a lot of upset in her country,  Trump reportedly told a person standing next to Ardern, promopting her to reply: No one marched when I was elected. She s correct. While Trump s inauguration failed to bring out supporters, marches across the nation in opposition of The Donald continued long after his election.Ardern says Trump  laughed  at her joke, but also reflected that it could have been taken in a very particular way. However Trump took it, he wasn t able to complete his traditional  power handshake  that has been embarrassing the country since his election. Ardern describes their handshake as  standard,  meaning Trump didn t try to yank her arm out of its socket as per usual.What s that word conservatives like to use and misuse? Oh, yes   Trump just got  cucked. ","November 17, 2017",0
 Chaos Ensues After Man Accidentally Shoots Himself And Wife In Church During Gun Safety Talk,"Maybe  thoughts and prayers  aren t the remedy following a shooting, after all. At the First United Methodist Church in East Tennessee, about 20 senior citizens gathered around for a holiday meal. After the meal, the group of elderly churchgoers decided to discuss gun safety. There has, after all, been a spate of mass shootings recently   as many as 317 so far this year. They got the idea for the conversation reportedly after a nearby county s sheriff s department held similar seminars at its local churches, according to Tellico Plains Police Chief Russ Parks. Well, I ve got my gun on me,  an 81-year-old member of the church in Tellico Plains said, according to Parks,  The Washington Post reports. The man then pulled out his holster in which he had a .38-caliber Ruger handgun. He promptly removed the magazine for everyone to see, then cleared the chamber and showed the gun to his fellow parishioners.The churchgoers discussed how to safely bring guns to church, then spoke of the deaths with recent mass shootings, like, for example, the recent Texas massacre in which a gunman shot 26 people dead as they sat in church.The 81-year-old man put the magazine back into the gun and put the gun back in the holster, Parks explained, but then later, while parishioners were cleaning up, one church member who had missed the demonstration asked the man to see the firearm   and that s when everything turned chaotic inside the church.The 81-year-old accidentally pulled the trigger without realizing the gun was loaded, then a bullet fired across the palm of the man s hand and toward his 80-year-old wife, who was sitting in a wheelchair next to him, entering her lower left abdomen, then it went out of the right side of her abdomen, into her right forearm and out the backside of her forearm. Following that, the bullet then ricocheted off the wall and landed under his wife s wheelchair, Parks said.That prompted panic in the church because some of the folks thought an active gunman was on the premises. They had their backs to it,  Parks said.  Somebody hollers,  He s been shot! She s been shot! Call 911! Due to a lot of panic during the calls to 911, the dispatcher assumed someone had entered the church and was shooting, so several schools were put on lockdown.The injured husband and wife were flown to the University of Tennessee Medical Center where they are listed critical condition.We re waiting for the NRA to say,  If only the wife had a gun, she could have protected herself.

 New Accuser Confirms She Got Roy Moore Banned From The Mall (VIDEOS),"Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore (R- Of Course) has a mounting list of women who say that he sexually harassed or assaulted them when they were teenagers. Another piece of that story is the rumor that Moore was so creepy with the girls that he was banned from a local mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama. That rumor had been unsubstantiated   until now.Becky Gray was working at the Gadsden Mall when she encountered Roy Moore, then an assistant district attorney. She was in her early 20 s, and he was in his 30 s. She said that Moore had taken a  creepy  liking to her, and constantly visited her at the mall. According to Gray, Moore hung out at the mall on Friday and Saturday nights   like teenagers do. She says of the situation: I mean, you ve got to understand   when you re that age, somebody in their 30s might as well have been 40 or 50   to me anyway. He d come back through [the department store] and if I was working, he would stop by and chit chat and that sort of thing, and it just kind of got creepy to me. Every Friday and Saturday night, he was down at the mall. Nobody his age is at the mall! You know, parents are dropping off their 12 year olds and 13 year olds, 14 year olds. I mean, come on, I just thought that was really creepy even way back then. Roy Moore repeatedly harassed Becky Gray at work, and she went to her manager about his behavior: I went to my manager and talked to him about it and asked him, basically, what could be done. Later on, he came back through my department and told me that [Moore] had been banned from the mall. In addition to Becky Gray s account, there is an account that Moore was banned from the mall by a man named Greg Legat who also worked there at the time. Here is video of his confirmation:So, every bit of this is true, in other words. Roy Moore actually hung out at the mall in order to creep on little girls and young women working there or hanging out there with their friends. This man is completely unfit to be a United States Senator, and if the people of Alabama elect him, he should be immediately expelled.Here is video of Becky Gray s account of Moore s mall banning, via ABC News:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images","November 17, 2017",0
 Roy Moore Is Asking People To Snitch On The Media And He’s Getting Trolled HARD (TWEETS),"Roy Moore is desperate to paint all these child molestation allegations against him as nothing more than a smear campaign   one that the media is busy amplifying for the sole purpose of taking him down.

So of course Twitter got hold of it, and now Moore is getting hilariously trolled.The blank form looks like this:An editor for Viewpoint Magazine tweeted it out, along with his response and a call for people to troll Moore this way.

 Trump Admin. Tosses Out Another Obama Rule – His Sons Can Be Even Worse Douchebags Now,"President Donald Trump has overturned another Obama-era legislation, this time the 2014 ban on trophy hunting permits, particularly those of elephants killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia, a US Fish and Wildlife Service official has confirmed. Trump s sons, Don Jr., and Eric, love being trophy-hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it.Don Jr., has hunted elephants before, and elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. That exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy-hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species. It s unlikely the Trump sons care about conservation, and only about their own glory and bragging rights.Nevertheless, a spokesman for Fish and Wildlife said,  Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. Despite large-scale conservation efforts, the wild elephant population in Africa plummeted 30% overall between 2007 and 2014 and by as much as 75% in some areas as a result of ivory poaching, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Prior to European colonization in the early 20th century, it is estimated that the wild elephant population in Africa was approximately 20 million, but dropped to 1.7 million by 1979. That number looks even more bleak when at last count in 2016 there were only just over 352,000 of the animals remaining on Africa s savanna in a survey where Namibia did not release any figures and surveys in South Sudan and the Central African Republic were postponed due to armed conflict.Last year, 182 countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets, however, Zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of President Trump. This new change would only apply to Zimbabwe and Zambia, but with Robert Mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of Zimbabwe, they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment.It makes you wonder why President Trump would be so interested in elephant poaching. Is it another distraction, this time from the possibility of Zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis? Could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in Trump Tower?Or is it simply because Trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it?Figures. pic.twitter.com/7LrFJeqaIY  Snarkar?ni  ?

Only one man perved on high school girls, one as young as 14-years-old. We re not justifying Franken s behavior. We re simply saying that Moore, a staunch right-wing Christian, has failed to admit to any wrongdoing, despite the fact that there are nine accusers and at least 30 people to corroborate the alleged victims  stories.

 Anti-Gay GOP Rep Gets BUSTED For Having Inappropriate Relations With A Man In His State Office,"Republicans are hypocrites.And Ohio state GOP Rep. Wes Goodman proved it this week after he got caught having an affair with a man.Normally, having an affair with a man would not be a big deal. After all, same-sex marriage is legal and relationships with men is no longer the scandal it once was. But Goodman is a conservative  Christian  Republican who is married to a woman, so his affair with a member of the same sex is absolutely scandalous.So scandalous, in fact, that Goodman resigned from his post on Wednesday. We all bring our own struggles and our own trials into public life,  Goodman said in a statement.  That has been true for me, and I sincerely regret that my actions and choices have kept me from serving my constituents and our state in a way that reflects the best ideals of public service. For those whom I have let down, I m sorry. As I move onto the next chapter of my life, I sincerely ask for privacy for myself, my family, and my friends. Sorry, Mr. Goodman. But you don t get privacy nor can you expect to not be mercilessly mocked.Goodman preached  family values  and thinks same-sex marriage should be illegal and that gay people should be punished for being gay. He even bragged about being committed to  natural marriage  on his own campaign website.Ohio House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger accepted Goodman s resignation after he confirmed the allegations during a meeting. I was alerted to details yesterday afternoon regarding his involvement in inappropriate behavior related to his state office,  Rosenburger said.  I met with him later in the day where he acknowledged and confirmed the allegations. It became clear that his resignation was the most appropriate course of action for him, his family, the constituents of the 87th House District and this institution. Frankly, affairs like this shouldn t matter as long as the relations were consensual. But the fact that Goodman was fiercely anti-gay and carried on the affair in his taxpayer funded office makes it newsworthy and even more explosive.Here s a report on the story via YouTube.Featured Image: Screenshot","November 16, 2017",0
 That Time Trump Mocked Marco Rubio For Drinking Water Just Came Back To Haunt Him,"While on the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump, a former reality show star, repeatedly mocked Sen. Marco Rubio for that time he drank water on the stage. Trump mocked Rubio at rallies about that and on Twitter, too. As they say, with this guy, there really is a tweet for everything. Trump did this after he kicked off his day blasting that  loser  network CNN, the  failing  New York Times and demanded a  thank you  from the UCLA basketball players who arrived in the states after being released from China. Then he summarized his trip to Asia, declaring it to be  the longest visit to the region by an American president in more than a quarter of a century.  He added that  America is back and the future has never looked better.  Then he seemed to have difficulty breathing and paused for water.Here is Trump doing that think he disparaged Rubio for doing:more proof that we're living in a simulation pic.twitter.com/7fGMxvRKUj  kevin driscoll (@kevndriscoll) November 15, 2017Trump grabbed a bottle of Fiji to quench his thirst, the exact brand that Rubio drank during the campaign. The Florida Republican responded on Twitter, saying,  Similar, but needs work on his form. Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera. But not bad for his 1st time.

 WATCH: Corporate CEOs SHOCK Trump’s Economic Adviser With Truth About GOP Tax Cuts,"Trump s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has bought into the GOP s tax plan lock, stock and barrel to the point where he likely has a deep belief that trickle-down economics actually works. The thing is, it doesn t, and at a Wall Street Journal event packed full of CEOs, Cohn seemed absolutely stunned that this crowd of corporate leaders wouldn t automatically say they d use the GOP s tax cuts to invest in their own companies.An editor from the Wall Street Journal asked the audience: If the tax reform bill goes through, do you plan to increase investment   your company s investment, capital investment? Only a few of them raised their hands indicating they would. Cohn s response was: Why aren t the other hands up? Really? Well, yes, really. It seems so easy to Cohn, apparently. One might even think that he genuinely doesn t understand why most of the CEOs in the room kept their hands down. Cohn now looks incredibly ignorant and stupid.Corporate tax cuts do not result in greater capital investment and these CEOs know it. Anybody who knows anything about business and economics (and even modern history) knows it. It s really quite simple: CEOs will not invest in things like new machinery, new factories, or new jobs when they don t have enough customer demand to justify it.In fact, most money saved from these kinds of tax cuts go toward stock buybacks, which is a controversial practice in which a company buys back its own stock to artificially drive prices up and put more money into the pockets of shareholders and the C-suite. CEO pay also tends to go up when taxes go down.CEOs know this. They want the tax cuts for precisely this reason. Their greed has gotten the best of them and they know tax cuts will make them richer. But they can t, and won t, commit to using the money they ll save on taxes to expanding operations and creating jobs because if they do, they create a PR nightmare for themselves.Watch Cohn get shocked below:1. Tax-overhaul backers say corporate rate cut will encourage investment by businesses 2. During #wsjceocouncil interview with Gary Cohn, WSJ asks CEOs to raise hands if they ll boost investment if rates cut 3. Few CEOS raise hands 4. Cohn asks:  Why aren t the other hands up?  pic.twitter.com/5PI60NlW0A  Tim Hanrahan (@TimJHanrahan) November 14, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images","November 15, 2017",0
 Texas Sheriff Threatens To Jail Truck Owner For Anti-Trump Sticker (SCREENSHOTS),"Good news everyone! All crime in Texas has been solved. How do we know this? Because Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy E. Nehls has announced that he s going on a crusade against protected political speech.Apparently, the Sheriff saw someone s anti-Trump sticker he placed on his truck and decided to take action pleasing the tortured little snowflakes who contacted him about it but also showing that not only he but an unnamed prosecutor is corrupt as f*ck. I have received numerous calls regarding the offensive display on this truck as it is often seen along FM 359. If you know who owns this truck or it is yours, I would like to discuss it with you,  the Sheriff posted on Facebook Wednesday.  Our Prosecutor has informed us she would accept Disorderly Conduct charges regarding it, but I feel we could come to an agreement regarding a modification to it. Yes, disorderly conduct. For a sticker. Because it s anti-Trump.Sorry, Sheriff. No  agreement  is necessary, as it is not a crime to criticize the President or people who voted for him. Naturally, Americans stopped by to laugh at the sheriff who claims that saying mean things about Trump constitutes an  immediate breach of the peace :       Unfortunately for the Sheriff, this matter was decided in the 1971 Supreme Court case, Cohen v. California. A man was convicted for disturbing the peace by wearing a  f*ck the draft  jacket, but the Supreme Court told those who would abuse the justice system by punishing protected political speech to f*ck off.Unfortunately, the goal here isn t to successfully prosecute someone. It s to make sure that the owner of the truck pays for being mean to Trump.Featured image via screengrab","November 15, 2017",0
 WATCH: Delusional Trump Fans Lash Out At Fox Host For Reporting Facts Of Uranium One Deal,"Clearly, Trump supporters want Fox News to lie to them.Because when Fox News host Shep Smith fact-checked Donald Trump s accusations against Hillary Clinton in regards to the Uranium One deal with Russia, they lost their shit.Smith thoroughly debunked Republican claims that Hillary Clinton approved the deal in a pay-to-play scam during her time as Secretary of State back in 2010.First, the deal had to be approved by a committee of nine agency heads, who unanimously approved.Second, the State Department was represented by an assistant who says Clinton did not intervene.Third, the Uranium One deal stipulates that the uranium must be sold to civilian reactor operators in the United States, which blows Trump s claim that Hillary gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia out of the water.Fourth, one man gave the Clinton Foundation all but $4 million of the $140 million donated by nine individuals associated with Uranium One. And that one man had already sold his stake in the company years before in 2007, well before Clinton even thought about being Secretary of State. And long before Barack Obama became president to make her Secretary of State.And, finally, Clinton had no power to veto or approve the deal herself.So, that means conservatives have no case against Clinton, effectively neutering any effort by the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor since doing so is contingent on the facts. And the facts support Clinton. So much so, that any court would laugh the obviously manufactured charges out of court.Here s the video via YouTube.In response, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum and called for Fox to fire Smith for reporting the facts.You need to get that hack @ShepNewsTeam out of Fox. He just made excuses for #CrookedHillary and is clearly a double agent. Hey Shep.. Hillary took the 145M regardless of when it was sent. Pay for play you goof  Lab Lover (@Dutchistheballs) November 14, 2017Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith should start a show on CNN called ""Pink Hat Brigade"" that's where you both belong. Shameful Fox, Get rid of these two asshats.  Matt Couch ? (@RealMattCouch) November 13, 2017@FoxNews if I wanted to see an unfactual and slanted view I would watch CNN. I can t watch Shepard Smith anymore. I m dont with that show. He is arrogant and clearly anti trump  Jim Hennahane (@limabean002) November 14, 2017And these are just a few of the MANY angry conservative tweets calling for Smith to be fired. However, a majority of the tweets came in support of Smith and his fact-based reporting, which blew apart the rest of the network s effort to spin the deal into a nefarious scandal proving that Hillary colluded with the Russians.Seriously.Shep Smith did his job as a journalist. Sean Hannity could certainly learn a lot from Smith. The Uranium One scandal being pushed by Trump and his minions has been repeatedly debunked. Conservatives are desperately attacking Clinton to distract from Trump s real scandals. But Smith refuses to lie to make Trump look good. And that s the real reason why Trump supporters hate him so much.Featured Image: Screenshot ","November 15, 2017",0
 Roy Moore Supporting Republican LOSES It After Being Called An Extremist,"If the scandal around the stories of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore s accusations of dating of teenage girls is accomplishing anything, it s drawing a line in the sand. Republicans are having to declare themselves either pro-pedophilia or anti.You d think it would be an easy choice to make, but hey, we have an accused pedophile in the White House, so maybe not so easy for the GOP party. Even Ted Cruz, though, who is one of the most extreme in Washington (and one of the most loathed) has withdrawn his support of Moore.One Republican, though, is holding on and he s shocked (I tell you) that anyone would ever call him an extremist over it.Rob Maness, who has the endorsement of Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Ben Carson, is running for the Louisiana State House. During a radio interview, a caller called Maness  an extremist,  precisely because he s to the right of Ted Cruz, at least on the subject of statutory rape.The caller went by the moniker of  flaming liberal  for WGSO-AM. His real name, though, is David Bellinger. He said about Maness,  If you re to the right of Ted Cruz, you re an extremist.  Hard to argue that since there is pretty much no one more extreme than Cruz, who believes that Planned Parenthood sells body parts and that the states can ignore the Supreme Court s ruling making gay marriage legal. Maness was having none of that accusation. Whoa, you just called me an extremist, brother,  said Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who went on to outline his military background, including top-secret clearances. I ve done everything this country has ever asked me to do. How dare you call me an extremist,  he said.  I m the most investigated, stable man that the country could have ever given the keys to nuclear weapons to, so you can blow me! You can blow me and get out of here if you re gonna talk like that and call me an extremist. Source: The AdvocateJust two things here: Maness is not running for an office where he would get the keys to nuclear weapons and well, his answer doesn t make him seem a very  stable man. Bellinger shot back, Go screw your ma, asshole,  several times.Maness, still fuming, said: I m not going to listen to that crap,  he said after jettisoning Bellinger.  Nobody s gonna call me an extremist, because I m not one. The extremists are the people who are liars, and the hypocrites and the swamp creatures from Washington, D.C. and Baton Rouge and all around the nation, even at the local level, that have got their political power and they try to smear people like me because we want to take it away from them. Stable, sure.Featured image via Facebook.","November 14, 2017",0
 That Story Trump Just Told The Press About Obama And Air Force One NEVER Happened,"On Tuesday, Donald Trump told a story about Air Force One and former President Barack Obama. The only problem is that it never happened. Before boarding the plane to come home, Trump told the press that Air Force One was denied landing rights in the Philippines during a trip by his predecessor because U.S. relations with the nation were so bad.Trump said Air Force One  never got to land  in the Philippines while be bragged about having  a very strong relationship  with the Southeast Asian nation. And as you know, we were having a lot of problems with the Philippines. The relationship with the past administration was horrible, to use a nice word,  Trump told reporters in Manila. I would say  horrible  is putting it mildly. You know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land,  he continued.  The plane came close but it didn t land. The Associated Press fact-checked Trump s bizarre claim:President Barack Obama last visited the Philippines in November 2015, arriving in Manila after an overnight flight from Turkey. There were no problems with landing the plane. Obama used the visit to announce the United States was transferring two ships to the Philippine Navy.Perhaps Trump was referring erroneously to Obama s aborted meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte? In September 2016, Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with the new Philippines leader in Laos after Duterte called him an obscene name. Duterte was warning Obama not to speak with him about the brutality of his crackdown on the illegal drug trade.Obama did visit the Philippines on several trips earlier in his presidency and even signed an enhanced defense cooperation agreement with the country in 2014, but Trump claimed that our relationship with the Philipines is  probably better than ever before. So it s very important that we get along with the Philippines, and we really do. We have a very good relationship. I would actually say probably better than ever before,  he said.Duterte has carried out an unlawful crackdown on suspected drug dealers and users, resulting in at least 7 thousand deaths by means including execution using death squads. Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. There are 3 million drug addicts. I d be happy to slaughter them,  Duterte declared in 2015.However, while Trump was there he largely ignored any discussion of human rights with the dictator. We understand that Trump is jealous of President Obama, but his lies prove why he has so much disdain for fact-checkers. It s sad that he doesn t have that same disdain for murderous dictators, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.","November 14, 2017",0
 This 4-Year Old Tweet From Donald Trump Shows Us He’s AT LEAST As Perverted As Roy Moore,"After Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was finally publicly outed after decades of alleged sexual abuses toward women, a #metoo hashtag formed and a dam broke. Suddenly it seemed that every time we turned on our computers, every time we received a phone alert, it was yet another man outed as an abuser.The worst of the worst of sexual abusers, though, are those who abuse children. Roy Moore, the right-wing Christian nut-job who s running for Senate in Alabama has been accused of doing just that. Five women have now come forward alleging that Moore  dated  them and worse while they were teens and he was in his 30s.This all began almost a year to the day after an audio tape of Donald Trump bragging about how he s such a big star he can just grab women s pussies. Is it possible, though, that Trump is as bad, if not worse, than Moore?While liberals and Democrats have decried the alleged abusers, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, Republicans have taken a *shall we say* more nuanced stance when it comes to Moore. They have invoked the Bible, saying that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Jesus was born. Of course, much like they forget the  well regulated militia  part of the Second Amendment, these men who would slut shame their own sisters if they were Democrats who wanted birth control, suddenly forgot the first part of Mary s moniker. They also defended Moore by saying that he was just a fragile young buck of 32, who couldn t have possibly known better, while his alleged victims were well on their way to adulthood at 14 and 16.Donald Trump has been surprisingly mum about the Moore allegations, but spokesperson Kellyanne Conway carefully straddled the line by saying that  if  the allegations were true, Moore should resign. Trump, though, had something interesting to say about the subject of statutory rape three years ago. In a tweet, Trump called it  talent  to  date  a woman who s young enough to be his daughter. Note: he was married to Melania at the time.@rexrode_lisa ""@realDonaldTrump you date girls young enough to be your daughter.That's perverted"" Dated. No, that's talent.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2013  This wasn t the first time Trump expressed interest in young girls. At least twice, Trump was heard saying that he would soon be dating girls who, at the time, were very underaged.Donald Trump once told 14-year-old girls, 'In a couple of years, I'll be dating you' https://t.co/nslYeqp8dg pic.twitter.com/ayDeW6nGNz  L.A. Times Politics (@latimespolitics) October 13, 2016  In 1992, he said about a 10-year-old girl that he would be  dating her in 10 years.  Here s the video:All of this, of course, was out there before the election and Trump voters didn t care. Trump voters in Alabama don t care about the allegations against Moore either. A poll taken after the accusations began to surface showed Moore with a 10 point lead against his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. If we haven t thrown in the moral towel as a country, Republicans certainly have. Jerry Falwell s moral majority has turned into an immoral minority of right-wing ideologues who would pimp out their own daughters if it meant putting another Republican in Congress.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.","November 13, 2017",0
 OOPS: Trump Judicial Nominee Didn’t Tell Congress About Marriage To White House Attorney,"This is a major conflict of interest that should automatically disqualify him.When the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to approve Donald Trump s nomination of Brett Talley to a federal judgeship in Alabama, they did so without knowing that Talley is married to White House lawyer Ann Donaldson, who is the chief of staff to White House counsel Donald McGahn.That s a pretty big detail to leave out of a disclosure form.According to the New York Times,Mr. Talley was asked on his publicly released Senate questionnaire to identify family members and others who are  likely to present potential conflicts of interest.  He did not mention his wife.District judges often provide the first ruling when laws are called into question, decisions that can put them at odds with the White House and its lawyers. Last month, for example, judges in Hawaii and Maryland temporarily blocked Mr. Trump s travel ban.Mr. Talley also did not mention his wife when he described his frequent contact with White House lawyers during the nomination process.Talley has also never tried a case in his life, making him even more unqualified to be a judge. In fact, the American Bar Association judged Tally as  unqualified  for the position in a very rare unanimous decision.The Senate could hold a confirmation vote as early as Monday, and it is important that they reject Talley, especially since he lied to them by omission.If Republicans confirm Talley, they will be telling future nominees that it s okay to lie to Congress in order to get an important job. That should not be allowed to happen. Trump and Republicans often claim that immigration should be based on merit. Well, becoming a federal judge should definitely be based on merit, not based on who you re married to and whether you ll be a rubber stamp for a corrupt administration.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images ","November 13, 2017",0
